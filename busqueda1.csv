Unfortunately, since those components are trained separately, MT often struggles to handle ASR errors, resulting in unnatural translation results. Recently, one work attempted to construct direct speech translation in a single model. The model used a multi-task scheme that learns to predict not only the target speech spectrograms directly but also the source and target phoneme transcription as auxiliary tasks. However, that work was only evaluated Spanish-English language pairs with similar syntax and word order. With syntactically distant language pairs, speech translation requires distant word order, and thus direct speech frame-to-frame alignments become difficult. Another direction was to construct a single deep-learning framework while keeping the step-by-step translation process. However, such studies focused only on speech-to-text translation. Furthermore, all of these works were based on a recurrent neural net-work (RNN) model. In this work, we propose a step-by-step scheme to a complete end-to-end speech-to-speech translation and propose a Transformer-based speech translation using Transcoder. We compare our proposed and multi-task model using syntactically similar and distant language pairs.","","978-1-7281-7066-4","10.1109/SLT48900.2021.9383496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9383496","speech-to-speech translation;Transcoder;Transformer;sequence-to-sequence model;multitask learning","Recurrent neural networks;Speech recognition;Syntactics;Predictive models;Machine translation;Task analysis;Spectrogram","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;recurrent neural nets;speech processing;speech recognition;speech synthesis","traditional speech translation systems;cascade manner;machine translation;MT;text-to-speech synthesis;step-by-step manner;ASR errors;unnatural translation results;direct speech translation;multitask scheme;target speech spectrograms;target phoneme transcription;Spanish-English language pairs;similar syntax;syntactically distant language pairs;distant word order;speech frame-to-frame alignments;step-by-step translation process;speech-to-text translation;net-work model;step-by-step scheme;complete end-to-end speech-to-speech translation;Transformer-based speech translation;similar language pairs","","20","","20","IEEE","25 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional speech-to-speech translation approaches concatenate automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-text machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech synthesizer (TTS) by text information. The current state-of-the-art models for ASR, MT, and TTS have mainly been built using deep neural networks, in particular, an attention-based encoder-decoder neural network with an attention mechanism. Recently, several works have constructed end-to-end direct speech-to-text translation by combining ASR and MT into a single model. However, the usefulness of these models has only been investigated on language pairs of similar syntax and word order (e.g., English-French or English-Spanish). For syntactically distant language pairs (e.g., English-Japanese), speech translation requires distant word reordering. Furthermore, parallel texts with corresponding speech utterances that are suitable for training end-to-end speech translation are generally unavailable. Collecting such corpora is usually time-consuming and expensive. This article proposes the first attempt to build an end-to-end direct speech-to-text translation system on syntactically distant language pairs that suffer from long-distance reordering. We train the model on English (subject-verb-object (SVO) word order) and Japanese (SOV word order) language pairs. To guide the attention-based encoder-decoder model on this difficult problem, we construct end-to-end speech translation with transcoding and utilize curriculum learning (CL) strategies that gradually train the network for end-to-end speech translation tasks by adapting the decoder or encoder parts. We use TTS for data augmentation to generate corresponding speech utterances from the existing parallel text data. Our experiment results show that the proposed approach provides significant improvements compared with conventional cascade models and the direct speech translation approach that uses a single model without transcoding and CL strategies.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2020.2986886","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP17H06101,JP17K00237); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072502","End-to-end speech-to-text translation;automatic speech recognition;machine translation (MT);multi-task learning","Task analysis;Decoding;Speech processing;Recurrent neural networks;Training;Adaptation models","computational linguistics;decoding;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;speech recognition;text analysis","source language;target language;ASR;text-to-text machine translation;MT;text-to-speech synthesizer;TTS;text information;attention-based encoder-decoder neural network;syntactically distant language pairs;speech utterances;training end-to-end speech translation;end-to-end direct speech-to-text translation system;Japanese language pairs;attention-based encoder-decoder model;direct speech translation approach;parallel text data;subject-verb-object word order;SOV word order;curriculum learning;data augmentation;speech translation","","16","","32","IEEE","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key new insight is that the informal register of conversational speech is a greater challenge for ASR than for SMT: the BLEU score for translating the reference transcript is 64%, but drops to 32% for translating automatic transcripts, whose word error rate (WER) is 40%. Several strategies are examined to mitigate the impact of ASR errors on the SMT output: (i) providing the ASR lattice, instead of the 1-best output, as input to the SMT system, (ii) training the SMT system on Spanish ASR output paired with English text, instead of Spanish reference transcripts, and (iii) improving the core ASR system. Each leads to consistent and complementary improvements in the SMT output. Compared to translating the 1-best output of an ASR system with 40% WER using an SMT system trained on Spanish reference transcripts, translating the output lattice of a better ASR system with 35% WER using an SMT system trained on ASR output improves BLEU from 32% to 38%.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854197","Speech Recognition;Natural Language Processing;Machine Translation;Human Language Technology;Spoken Language Translation","Speech;Lattices;Training;Speech recognition;Conferences;Acoustics;Speech processing","error analysis;language translation;speech recognition","Spanish conversational telephone speech translation;English text;automatic speech recognition system;statistical machine translation system;SMT system;informal register;BLEU score;automatic transcripts;word error rate;WER;ASR errors;SMT output;ASR lattice;Spanish reference transcripts;core ASR system","","3","","20","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To our knowledge, only a few methods for integrating ASR models with MT models in parallel have been studied. In this paper, we systematically study a number of different translation models in the context of the N-best list rescoring. As an alternative to the N -best list rescoring, we use ASR word graphs in order to arrive at a tighter integration of ASR and MT models. The experiments are carried out on two tasks: English-to-German with an ASR vocabulary size of 17 K words, and Spanish-to-English with an ASR vocabulary of 58 K words.

Most machine translation training data consists of well-formed written texts, causing issues when translating spontaneous speech. Previous work has introduced an intermediate step between speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) to remove disfluencies, making the data better-matched to typical translation text and significantly improving performance. However, with the rise of end-to-end speech translation systems, this intermediate step must be incorporated into the sequence-to-sequence architecture. Further, though translated speech datasets exist, they are typically news or rehearsed speech without many disfluencies (e.g. TED), or the disfluencies are translated into the references (e.g. Fisher). To generate clean translations from disfluent speech, cleaned references are necessary for evaluation. We introduce a corpus of cleaned target data for the Fisher Spanish-English dataset for this task. We compare how different architectures handle disfluencies and provide a baseline for removing disfluencies in end-to-end translation.","","978-1-5386-4334-1","10.1109/SLT.2018.8639661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8639661","speech translation;disfluency removal;spoken language translation;spoken language processing","Task analysis;Hidden Markov models;Speech recognition;Training data;Speech processing;Data models;Lapping","language translation;speech recognition","conversational speech phenomena;machine translation training data;end-to-end speech translation systems;sequence-to-sequence architecture;clean translations;disfluent speech;end-to-end translation;fluent translations;speech datasets","","4","","15","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional translation systems consist of multiple steps like speech recognition, text to text machine translation, and speech generation. Issue with these systems are, latency due to multiple steps and error propagation from first steps toward last steps. Another challenge is that many spoken languages do not have text representation, so traditional system involving speech to text and text to text translation do not work. In this paper, we are presenting a recurrent neural network (RNN) based translation system that can generate a direct waveform of target language audio. We have used the sparse coding technique for the extraction and inversion of audio features. An attention-based multi-layered sequence to sequence model is trained using a novel technique on a dataset of Spanish to English audio and no intermediate text representation is used while training or inference. We have done performance comparison of proposed approaches using latency, bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score and Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality PESQ score analysis.

A Spanish speech to English text translation system has been built using data from the TC-STAR European project. The speech recognizer is a state-of-the-art multipass system trained for the Spanish EPPS task and the statistical translation system relies on the IBM-4 model. First, MT results are compared using manual transcriptions and 1-best ASR hypotheses with different word error rates. Then, a n-best interface between the ASR and MT components is investigated to improve the STT process. Derivation of the fundamental equation for machine translation suggests that the source language model is not necessary for STT. This was investigated by using weak source language models and by n-best rescoring adding the acoustic model score only. A significant loss in the BLEU score was observed suggesting that the source language model is needed given the insufficiencies of the translation model. Adding the source language model score in the n-best rescoring process recovers the loss and slightly improves the BLEU score over the 1-best ASR hypothesis. The system achieves a BLEU score of 37.3 with an ASR word error rate of 10% and a BLEU score of 40.5 using the manual transcripts","","0-7803-9478-X","10.1109/ASRU.2005.1566514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1566514","","Speech recognition;Automatic speech recognition;Natural languages;Speech synthesis;Error analysis;Statistics;Equations;Humans;Vocabulary","language translation;natural languages;speech recognition;speech synthesis","speech to text translation;European Parliamentary speeches;speech recognizer;multipass system;machine translation;source language model;BLEU score","","","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper aims to leverage the open source applications of these technologies, machine translation, text-to-speech system (TTS), and speech-to-text system (STT) to convert available online resources to Indian languages. This application takes an English language video as an input and separates the audio from video. It then divides the audio file into several smaller chunks based on the timestamps. These audio chunks are then individually converted into text using IBM Watson's speech-to-text (STT) module. The obtained text chunks are then concatenated and passed to Google's machine translate API for conversion to the requested Indian language. After this translation, a TTS system is required to convert the text into the desired audio output. Not many open source TTS systems are available for Indian regional languages. One such available application is the flite engine (a lighter version of Festival engine developed by Prof. Alan Black at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)). This flite engine is used as TTS for generating audio from translated text. The accuracy of the application developed can be as high as 91 percent for a single video and averages about 79 percent. This accuracy is verified by comparing naturality of the audio with the general spoken language. This application is beneficial to visually impaired people as well as individuals who are not capable of reading text to acquire knowledge in their native language. In future, this application aims to achieve ubiquitous communication enabling people of different regions to communicate with each other breaking the language barriers.","2158-3412","978-1-7281-5480-0","10.1109/ISTAS48451.2019.8937988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937988","machine translation;text-to-speech;speech-to-text;concatenation;open innovation","Technological innovation;Videos;Engines;Optical character recognition software;Natural language processing;Business","application program interfaces;language translation;natural language processing;public domain software;speech synthesis;text analysis","machine translation;Indian regional languages;open innovation;foreign languages;natural language processing;communication domains;open source applications;text-to-speech system;speech-to-text system;STT;Indian languages;English language video;audio file;audio chunks;IBM Watson;text chunks;Indian language;audio output;open source TTS systems;flite engine;translated text;general spoken language;native language;language barriers;speech-to-text module;English videos;machine translate API","","1","","21","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It heavily depends on direct ST data and is less efficient in making use of speech transcription and text translation data, which is often more easily available. In the related field of multilingual text translation, several techniques have been proposed for zero-shot translation. A main idea is to increase the similarity of semantically similar sentences in different languages. We investigate whether these ideas can be applied to speech translation, by building ST models trained on speech transcription and text translation data. We investigate the effects of data augmentation and auxiliary loss function. The techniques were successfully applied to few-shot ST using limited ST data, with improvements of up to +12.9 BLEU points compared to direct end-to-end ST and +3.1 BLEU points compared to ST models fine-tuned from ASR model.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9746815","speech translation;zero-shot;few-shot;machine translation;multi-task","Conferences;Buildings;Signal processing;Multitasking;Data models;Acoustics;Machine translation","language translation;natural language processing;speech enhancement","tackling data scarcity;zero-shot multilingual machine translation techniques;end-to-end speech translation;direct ST data;speech transcription;text translation data;multilingual text translation;zero-shot translation;ST models;data augmentation;auxiliary loss function;few-shot ST;end-to-end ST;ST;semantically similar sentences;different languages;speech translation;limited ST data;ASR;ASR model","","","","17","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional S2ST systems follow a cascaded approach, where three modules automatics speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech translation (TTS) are concatenated to obtain the final translated speech utterance. The cascaded nature of the system results in the propagation of errors from one module to another. This, in turn, leads to the degradation in the overall performance of the S2ST task. With the evolution of the deep learning approaches to speech processing, many attempts have been made to perform end-to-end and direct speech-to-speech translation (DS2ST). But most of these approaches rely on language transcripts in one way or the other. In this work, we aim to perform the DS2ST task without using language transcripts. In this direction we have performed three experiments: First, we have investigated the direct learning of mapping function from source to target language with the increase in the number of utterances. Second, we have analyzed how the learning function improves with an increase in the number of Bi-LSTM layers. Third, we have observed how the system behaves with the unknown speakers (not used during training) during inference. From the experiments, it has been observed that with the increase in the number of utterances and layers, the quality of translation improves. And also, with a speaker and text-dependent training of approximately 4.4 hrs of speech, the model can generate the target language utterance even for unknown speakers. Though the generated utterance quality is not that good, but intelligent to some extent to be perceived.","2472-7695","979-8-3503-9856-4","10.1109/O-COCOSDA202257103.2022.9997945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9997945","Speech to speech translation (S2ST);Voice Conversion (VC);Bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM)","Training;Degradation;Deep learning;Databases;Machine translation;Task analysis;Speech processing","deep learning (artificial intelligence);language translation;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speaker recognition;speech processing","automatic speech recognition;Bi-LSTM layers;deep learning;DS2ST task;final translated speech utterance;language transcripts;machine translation;machine translation;S2ST task;speech processing;speech-to-speech translation;text-to-speech translation;unknown speakers","","","","29","IEEE","28 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the trained translation model tends to focus on ensuring the accuracy of the generated target word at the current time-step and does not consider its future cost which means the expected cost of generating the subsequent target translation (i.e., the next target word). To respond to this issue, in this article, we propose a simple and effective method to model the future cost of each target word for NMT systems. In detail, a future cost representation is learned based on the current generated target word and its contextual information to compute an additional loss to guide the training of the NMT model. Furthermore, the learned future cost representation at the current time-step is used to help the generation of the next target word in the decoding.

This approach naturally exhibits very low latency and high final quality, but at the cost of incremental instability as the output is continuously refined. We experiment with a pipeline of industry-grade speech recognition and translation tools, augmented with simple inference heuristics to improve stability.

However, this processing on the source representation only adopts a single source feature and excludes richer and more diverse features such as recurrence features, local features, and syntactic features, which results in tedious representation and thereby hinders the further translation performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient method to encode more diverse source features into the input representation simultaneously, and thereby learning an effective source representation by self-attention networks. In particular, the proposed grouped strategy is only applied to the input representation layer, to keep the diversity of translation information and the efficiency of the self-attention networks at the same time.

In order to develop a successful S2ST system three subsystems are required namely, automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, machine translation (MT) system and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) system. Hidden Markov models based ASR system is developed for both the languages and their performances are analyzed based on the word error rate (WER). The MT subsystem makes use of the statistical machine translation (SMT) approach for the purpose of translating the text between the two languages involved. The SMT makes use of IBM alignment models and language models to enable proper translation. The performance of MT is analyzed based on translated edit rate (TER) and analysis of the translation table. HMM-based speech synthesis system (HTS) is used to synthesize the translated text.

The use of Automatic Speech Recognition, and Machine Translation for second language learning, here learning Hindi by English speaker, has been illustrated by taking English speech as input and translating the given English sentences and words into Hindi and then displaying its equivalent construct in Devanagari script. The interactive system under study displays and speaks the same. It has been observed that a second language can be learnt faster by frequently listening to the vocabulary and sentences of the language. Thus the system furnishes the functionality of speaking the sentence in Hindi once it is represented in Devanagari script. The English sentences and words from the grammar tool books are given as input to the system for experimentation. We have observed that the critical problem encountered while doing so is the translation of English to Hindi. Another problem encountered at times is insertion error for letters (only surfaced). The system cannot translate sentences represented using continuous tense and perfect continuous tense correctly. The overall accuracy of the system, otherwise, is approximately 67% which can help the second language learners in the beginning.","","978-1-6654-9499-1","10.1109/INCET54531.2022.9824940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9824940","Natural Language Processing;Automatic Speech Recognition;Language Learning;Machine Translation","Vocabulary;Interactive systems;Natural languages;Grammar;Machine translation;Speech processing;Automatic speech recognition","computer aided instruction;grammars;language translation;linguistics;natural language processing;speech intelligibility;speech recognition","machine translation;English speaker;formulating sentences;verbatim translation;English words;corresponding Hindi words;Hindi sentences;language learners;language learning;English speech;English sentences;interactive system leveraging automatic speech recognition;Devanagari script;grammar tool books;Hindi","","","","11","IEEE","15 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Voice Recognition module captures the voice or speech from the mobile user through speaker, identifies then converts the speech into text and then the text send to Machine Translation for further process. Machine Translation module does the process of translation i.e. this module consists of library for both language and when text is received by this module, it converts the text of one language to another as per user choice and thus it sends the translated text to last module. Speech Synthesis module acts as the text to speech translator i.e. when it gets the translated text. This module processes on translated text which converts it into speech and then makes it as user output. Thus, Voice Translation application works by integrating all these three modules and gives the user best output.","","978-1-4799-4190-2","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993116","Voice Recognition;Machine Translation;Multilingual speech","Speech;Speech recognition;Bluetooth;Speech synthesis;Accuracy;Text recognition","Bluetooth;language translation;natural language processing;smart phones;speech recognition;speech synthesis","multilingual speech to speech translation system;Bluetooth environment;voice translator;Android mobile phone;English speech-Hindi speech translation;voice recognition;machine translation;speech synthesis;text-speech translator","","","","9","IEEE","22 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with the conventional statistical machine translation, which separately optimizes each component model (such as acoustic models and language models) in series, NMT can learn the used DNN to directly maximize the overall translation performance. In particular, a novel encoder-decoder DNN structure termed transformer, which Google develops, has been applied in NMT and revealed outstanding translation performance. In this study, we investigate and evaluate the Transformer-based speech translation algorithm by varying the model settings in the training process of the used Transformer. The experiments follow a tutorial script provided in the Tensorflow forum, which are conducted on the TED talk dataset to translate Portuguese to English, which consists of 50,000 utterances for training, 1,100 utterances for validation, and 2,000 utterances for testing. The baseline system, which sets the encoding dimension as 128, the number of encoder/decoder layers as 4, the dropout rate as 0.1 and the negative exponent as −1.5, gives rise to 68.01% in translation accuracy. While the encoding dimension is increased to be 512, the translation accuracy can be promoted to be 76.02%. Also, changing the number of layers to be 2, the dropout rate to be 0.01 and the negative exponent to be 1 can achieve 70.98%, 80.97% and 75.40% in translation accuracy, respectively.

In response to this problem, we propose a simple and efficient method to integrate prior translation knowledge into NMT in a universal manner that is compatible with neural networks. Meanwhile, it enables NMT to consider the crossing language translation knowledge from the source-side of the training pipeline of NMT, thereby making full use of the prior translation knowledge to enhance the performance of NMT.

Most combination schemes perform an alignment between different system outputs in order to produce lattices (or confusion networks), from which a composite hypothesis is chosen, possibly with the help of a large language model. The benefit of this approach is two-fold: (i) whenever many systems agree with each other on a set of words, the combination output contains these words with high confidence; and (ii) whenever the systems disagree, the language model resolves the ambiguity based on the (probably correct) agreed upon context. The case of machine translation system combination is more challenging because of the different word orders of the translations: the alignment has to incorporate computationally expensive movements of word blocks. In this paper, we show how one can combine translation outputs efficiently, extending the incremental alignment procedure of (A-V.I. Rosti et al., 2008).

A ST system consists of two major components: an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) and a machine translator (MT). Nowadays, most ASR systems are trained and tuned by minimizing word error rate (WER). However, WER counts word errors at the surface level. It does not consider the contextual and syntactic roles of a word, which are often critical for MT. In the end-to-end ST scenarios, whether WER is a good metric for the ASR component of the full ST system is an open issue and lacks systematic studies. In this paper, we report our recent investigation on this issue, focusing on the interactions of ASR and MT in a ST system. We show that BLEU-oriented global optimization of ASR system parameters improves the translation quality by an absolute 1.5% BLEU score, while sacrificing WER over the conventional, WER-optimized ASR system. We also conducted an in-depth study on the impact of ASR errors on the final ST output.

However, if the aim of the system is a speech-to-text translation, a post-processing stage must be included in order to convert the non-word sequences into word sentences. In this paper a technique to perform this conversion as well as an experimental test carried out over a task oriented Spanish corpus are reported.

However, the problem is that it is prohibitively expensive to build the vital resource, a large-scale corpus of bilingual dialogues covering many domains. We propose to substitute a combination of two different types of bilingual corpora: (1) a large-scale collection of basic sentences that covers many domains; and (2) a small-scale collection of spoken dialogues that reflects the characteristics of the spoken utterances for the large-scale corpus of dialogues. With these two corpora, we have been building a translation module for a speech-to-speech translation system. By using the basic sentence corpus, we have achieved high-quality translations with several machine-learning approaches. Based on an analysis of the spoken dialogue corpus, we found that splitting utterances into parts and concatenating the translated parts is an effective way to translate the longer utterances that are inherent in a spoken dialogue.","","0-7803-7980-2","10.1109/ASRU.2003.1318517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318517","","Natural languages;Large-scale systems;Speech;Machine learning;Laboratories;Cities and towns;Humans;System testing;Vocabulary;Oral communication","language translation;speech recognition;speech synthesis;learning (artificial intelligence)","speech-to-speech translation system;sentence collection method;utterance collection method;corpus-based technology;bilingual dialogue corpus;spoken dialogue utterance splitting;machine learning methods","","","","23","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, UBWE focuses on initializing the word embedding layer in the encoder and decoder of UNMT, whereas the CMLM focuses on initializing the entire encoder and decoder of UNMT. However, UBWE/CMLM training and UNMT training are independent, which makes it difficult to assess how the quality of UBWE/CMLM affects the performance of UNMT during UNMT training. In this paper, we first empirically explore relationships between UNMT and UBWE/CMLM. The empirical results demonstrate that the performance of UBWE and CMLM has a significant influence on the performance of UNMT. Motivated by this, we propose a novel UNMT structure with cross-lingual language representation agreement to capture the interaction between UBWE/CMLM and UNMT during UNMT training.

Two source languages, Mandarin and Arabic, are recognised and then translated using a phrase-based statistical machine translation system into English.

But vocabulary manipulation is hard to apply to the end-to-end speech-text translation, because neither source text nor speech-to-target mapping is available. We introduce a method that avoids this dependence. Through learning the projection between sentence-level speech encoder output and final target vocabulary, the proposed method allows self-contained vocabulary manipulation without knowing source speech transcripts or dictionaries. Experimental results show that the proposed method speed up about 20% while keep the comparable translation quality.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-6631-5","10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9053431","end-to-end;speech-to-text;speed","Vocabulary;Dictionaries;Conferences;Signal processing;Acoustics;Machine translation;Speech processing","dictionaries;language translation;natural language processing;speech processing;text analysis;vocabulary","dictionaries;sentence-level speech encoder;speech-to-target mapping;end-to-end speech-text translation;source sentence;machine translation;self-contained vocabulary manipulation;source speech transcripts","","","","20","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The language modeling community is showing a growing interest in using large collections of auxiliary textual material to supplement sparse in-domain resources. One of the problems in using such auxiliary corpora is that they may differ significantly from the specific nature of the domain of interest. In this paper, we propose three different methods for adapting language models for a speech to speech (S2S) translation system when auxiliary corpora are of different genre and domain. The proposed methods are based on centroid similarity, n-gram ratios and resampled language models. We show how these methods can be used to select out of domain textual data such as newswire text to improve a S2S system. We were able to achieve an overall relative improvement of 3.8% in BLEU score over a baseline system that uses only in-domain conversational data.","2379-190X","978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4960709","Language Model Adaptation;Machine Translation;Domain Adaptation","Natural languages;Adaptation model;Entropy;Speech coding;Materials testing;System testing;Performance gain;Text categorization;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification","language translation;speech processing","auxiliary data resampling;language model adaptation;machine translation;n-gram language models;speech to speech translation system;language modeling community","","5","2","16","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Speech recognition is a system which generates text for the given speech, while a speech synthesizer is a system that should be able to read any text aloud. Research is conducting all over the world, to develop an efficient text to speech synthesis (TTS) system for minority languages. India has the largest democracy system in the world, also known as land of unity in diversity and has more than 22 official languages. It becomes difficult to understand the English and the other European languages to common people. This works aims to help people to translate English text to their own language and implement a TTS for the minority language, Malayalam. It is achieved by combining both Machine Translation and TTS. When an English text is given, it is translated to Malayalam with the help of a parser, using grammatical rules, applying morphology and a bilingual dictionary. From each of the translated Malayalam text, syllables are separated. A good number of syllables are recorded and stored in the syllable corpus. Syllables are concatenated to generate a synthesized Malayalam speech. Machine translation of English to Malayalam text is tested and achieved 73 percentage accuracy. For the TTS system, accuracy is verified by checking the naturalness and intelligibility. 87 percentages of the sentences are uttered correctly.","","978-1-5090-3751-3","10.1109/ICETT.2016.7873642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7873642","Machine Translation System;Text to Speech synthesis;Speech recognition;Articulatory synthesis;Formant synthesis;Concatenation","Speech;Dictionaries;Speech recognition;Speech synthesis;Syntactics;Market research;Morphology","language translation;speech recognition;speech synthesis","text to speech synthesis system;English translation;Malayalam translation;speech recognition;speech synthesizer;text aloud;TTS system;minority languages;democracy system;European languages;machine translation;English text;parser;grammatical rules;bilingual dictionary;Malayalam text;syllable corpus;Malayalam speech;intelligibility","","2","","19","IEEE","9 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in some domain-specific tasks, only the corpora from similar domains can improve translation performance. If out-of-domain corpora are directly added into the in-domain corpus, the translation performance may even degrade. Therefore, domain adaptation techniques are essential to solve the NMT domain problem. Most existing methods for domain adaptation are designed for the conventional phrase-based machine translation. For NMT domain adaptation, there have been only a few studies on topics such as fine tuning, domain tags, and domain features. In this paper, we have four goals for sentence level NMT domain adaptation. First, the NMT's internal sentence embedding is exploited and the sentence embedding similarity is used to select out-of-domain sentences that are close to the in-domain corpus. Second, we propose three sentence weighting methods, i.e., sentence weighting, domain weighting, and batch weighting, to balance the data distribution during NMT training. Third, in addition, we propose dynamic training methods to adjust the sentence selection and weighting during NMT training. Fourth, to solve the multidomain problem in a real-world NMT scenario where the domain distributions of training and testing data often mismatch, we proposed a multidomain sentence weighting method to balance the domain distributions of training data and match the domain distributions of training and testing data. The proposed methods are evaluated in international workshop on spoken language translation (IWSLT) English-to-French/German tasks and a multidomain English-to-French task. Empirical results show that the sentence selection and weighting methods can significantly improve the NMT performance, outperforming the existing baselines.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2018.2837223","“Promotion of Global Communications Plan: Research, Development, and Social Demonstration of Multilingual Speech Translation Technology” program of MIC, Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8360031","Neural machine translation;domain adaptation","Training;Adaptation models;Task analysis;Speech processing;Testing;Training data;Decoding","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;statistical analysis","sentence selection;neural machine translation domain adaptation;machine translation tasks;domain-specific tasks;translation performance;out-of-domain corpora;in-domain corpus;domain adaptation techniques;NMT domain problem;conventional phrase-based machine translation;domain tags;sentence level NMT domain adaptation;sentence embedding similarity;out-of-domain sentences;sentence weighting methods;domain weighting;NMT training;dynamic training methods;real-world NMT scenario;multidomain sentence;NMT performance;NMT internal sentence embedding","","17","","85","IEEE","16 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two auxiliary tasks, a denoising autoencoder task and machine translation task, are proposed to be co-trained with ASR and ST tasks respectively.

However, it is losing favour in contemporary India. Sanskrit is not widely used in current times due in large part to the lack of resources for translation into and out of it. In recent years, machine translation (MT) has improved above and beyond the norm and is now typically performed utilising supervised learning approaches. Due to the paucity of comparable corpora for Sanskrit, new research in the unsupervised MT domain appears to have promise for Sanskrit. With the aid of manually created parallel corpora for the Sanskrit-Hindi language pair, an analysis is conducted between various modelling techniques of building a machine translation system, namely Statistical and Neural, in order to bridge the gap between Sanskrit and its contemporary successor Hindi. In order to provide a fresh viewpoint on the area as a whole, the primary benefits and drawbacks of statistical and neural machine translation has been examined in this work. Our results suggest that Neural machine translation modelling technique performs better than Statistical machine translation.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10064790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064790","Low-resource;Sanskrit;Machine Translation;Statistical-based;Neural-based;Natural language processing","Analytical models;Supervised learning;Buildings;Machine translation;Speech processing;Artificial intelligence","language translation;natural language processing;statistical analysis;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","ancient Indian religious scriptures;contemporary successor Hindi;multimodal machine translation;neural machine translation modelling technique;Sanskrit-Hindi language pair;statistical machine translation;supervised learning approaches;unsupervised MT domain","","","","28","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, it seeks to implement an artificial Text To Speech (TTS) system trained with a Neural Network with a given dataset of Mel spectrograms in [3] from a person speaking in Nahuatl and it attempts to achieve a natural voice output as a spectrogram, then process it and obtain the sound desired. Finally, once trained, these models can be prepared for being used within mobile devices, and even taking advantage of the neural engine some of them are equipped with. In this way, this technology can reach more people and help to preserve and even spread the language. The early results showed how the limited resources of this language could cause a strong bias in the outputs and also how there could be some loss of information given the morphemes Nahuatl has, given its polysynthetic nature. This also highlights the way it can be tokenized, playing an important role in how the results turn out obtaining a BLEU score of 0.34 at best. Finally, this application and research can be an interesting framework of how a polysynthetic language can be manipulated to be used for fusional languages like Spanish or English.

Information obtained from the source language document, including translation probabilities derived from statistical machine translation (SMT) and named entity tags derived from named entity recognition (NER), is incorporated with acoustic phonetic information obtained from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. One advantage of the system combination used here is that words that are not included in the ASR vocabulary can be correctly decoded by the combined system. The MAHT model and system implementation is presented. It is shown that a relative decrease in word error rate of 29% can be obtained by this combined system relative to the baseline ASR performance on a French to English document translation task in the Hansard domain.

In this paper, we take the first step towards exploiting the multilingual Transformer translation model to produce expressive sentence representations for PCM. Since the traditional Transformer lacks an immediate sentence representation, we pool the output representation of the encoder as the sentence representation, which is further optimized as a part of the training flow of the translation model. Experiments conducted on the BUCC PCM task show that the proposed method improves mining performance over the existing methods with the assistance of the pre-trained multilingual BERT.

Therefore to train a direct S2ST system, previous works usually utilize text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate samples in the target language by augmenting the data from speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, there is a limited investigation into how the synthesized target speech would affect the S2ST models. In this work, we analyze the effect of changing synthesized target speech for direct S2ST models. We find that simply combining the target speech from different TTS systems can potentially improve the S2ST performances. Following that, we also propose a multi-task framework that jointly optimizes the S2ST system with multiple targets from different TTS systems.

To avoid the reliance on such annotated TQE data, this paper proposes an approach to train word-level TQE models using bilingual corpora, which are typically used in machine translation training and is relatively easier to access. We formalize the training of our proposed method under the framework of maximum marginal likelihood estimation.

However, building a model for the evaluation of machine translation still faces the following challenges: 1) large scale of the training data affects the speed of the optimization; 2) the varied quality of the training data makes the optimization process unstable. To alleviate the issues of data learning, curriculum learning is proposed to rearrange the training sequence following an “easy-to-hard” process. However, the definition of difficulty can not be directly applied to the training data used in the machine translation evaluation. Hence, we propose an obscurity-quantified curriculum learning framework for this task. Specifically, the obscurity of each training example can be measured from multiple perspectives, including the difficulty of ranking, the fuzziness of reference, the complexity of text, and the unreliability of judgement. To incorporate the obscurity measurements, we also design a dynamic learning strategy to guide the training process from instances with low obscurity to those with high-obscurity.

We show the effectiveness of multilingual end-to-end ST in two scenarios: one-to-many and many-to-many translations with publicly available data. We experimentally confirm that multilingual end-to-end ST models significantly outperform bilingual ones in both scenarios.

Recent studies have introduced many improvements that allow existing S2ST systems to handle not only linguistic meaning but also paralinguistic information such as emphasis by proposing additional emphasis estimation and translation components. However, the approach used for emphasis translation is not optimal for sequence translation tasks and fails to easily handle the long-term dependencies of words and emphasis levels. It also requires the quantization of emphasis levels and treats them as discrete labels instead of continuous values. Moreover, the whole translation pipeline is fairly complex and slow because all components are trained separately without joint optimization. In this paper, we make two contributions: 1) we propose an approach that can handle continuous emphasis levels based on sequence-to-sequence models, and 2) we combine machine and emphasis translation into a single model, which greatly simplifies the translation pipeline and make it easier to perform joint optimization. Our results on an emphasis translation task indicate that our translation models outperform previous models by a large margin in both objective and subjective tests. Experiments on a joint translation model also show that our models can perform joint translation of words and emphasis with one-word delays instead of full-sentence delays while preserving the translation performance of both tasks.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2018.2846402","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP17H06101,JP17K00237); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8379460","Emphasis estimation;emphasis translation;speech-to-speech translation (S2ST);joint optimization of words and emphasis","Pipelines;Task analysis;Speech processing;Hidden Markov models;Quantization (signal);Optimization;Linguistics","language translation;natural language processing;optimisation;speech processing;speech synthesis","Emphasis Speech Translation Speech-to-speech translation systems;S2ST systems;sequence translation tasks;joint optimization;sequence-to-sequence models;emphasis translation task;translation models;joint translation model;translation performance;emphasis estimation","","5","","32","IEEE","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lack of alignment in neural machine translation models leads to three problems: it is hard to (1) interpret the translation process, (2) impose lexical constraints, and (3) impose structural constraints. These problems not only increase the difficulty of designing new architectures for neural machine translation, but also limit its applications in practice. To alleviate these problems, we propose to introduce explicit phrase alignment into the translation process of arbitrary neural machine translation models. The key idea is to build a search space similar to that of phrase-based statistical machine translation for neural machine translation where phrase alignment is readily available. We design a new decoding algorithm that can easily impose lexical and structural constraints.

However, previous research has shown that NMT suffers from several limitations: source coverage guidance, translation of rare words, and the limited vocabulary, while statistical machine translation (SMT) has complementary properties that correspond well to these limitations. It is straightforward to improve the translation performance by combining the advantages of two kinds of models. This paper proposes a general framework for incorporating the SMT word knowledge into NMT to alleviate above word-level limitations. In our framework, the NMT decoder makes more accurate word prediction by referring to the SMT word recommendations in both training and testing phases. Specifically, the SMT model offers informative word recommendations based on the NMT decoding information. Then, we use the SMT word predictions as prior knowledge to adjust the NMT word generation probability, which unitizes a neural network based classifier to digest the discrete word knowledge. In this paper, we use two model variants to implement the framework, one with a gating mechanism and the other with a direct competition mechanism. Experimental results on Chinese-to-English and English-to-German translation tasks show that the proposed framework can take advantage of the SMT word knowledge and consistently achieve significant improvements over NMT and SMT baseline systems.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2018.2860287","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61525205,61432013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421063","Neural machine translation;statistical machine translation;hybrid translation;translation combination","Decoding;Knowledge engineering;Modeling;Neural networks;Speech processing;Vocabulary;Training;Statistical learning","language translation;natural language processing;neural nets;probability;statistical analysis;vocabulary","NMT decoder;SMT word recommendations;NMT decoding information;NMT word generation probability;neural network;English-to-German translation tasks;SMT word knowledge;neural machine translation;vocabulary;statistical machine translation;neural network based classifier;Chinese-to-Englishh translation","","32","","64","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mainstream solutions for such tasks are to cascade automatic speech recognition with machine translation, for which the transcriptions of the source language are needed in training. End-to-end approaches for ST tasks have been investigated because of not only technical interests such as to achieve globally optimized solution, but the need for ST tasks for the many source languages worldwide which do not have written form. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end ST framework with two decoders to handle the relatively deeper relationships between the source language audio and target language text.

Moreover, the discrepancy between training and inference exacerbates this limitation; 2) this left-to-right decoding way cannot make full use of the target-side future information, which leads to the issue of unbalanced outputs. On the one hand, we alleviate the first limitation with a history-refining module, which learns to examine the quality of each history word by assigning it a confidence score. The confidence score is further used as a gate to control the amount of its word embedding flowing to the decoder. On the other hand, we attack the second limitation with a future-foreseeing module, which learns the distribution of future translation at each decoding time step. More importantly, we further propose refining history for future-aware NMT since the two modules can be closely incorporated as they focus on different kinds of context. Experimental results on various translation tasks with different scaled datasets, including WMT English$\leftrightarrow${German, French, Romanian}, show that our proposed approach achieves significant improvements over strong Transformer-based NMT baselines.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3226332","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62036004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989330","Neural machine translation;refine history;foresee future;mutual promotion;left-to-right decoding","Training;Refining;Logic gates;Transformers;Decoding;History;Machine translation","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;regression analysis;word processing","confidence score;decoding time step;future-aware neural machine translation;future-aware NMT;future-foreseeing module;history information;history-refining module;inference exacerbates;source sentence;target words auto-regressively;target-side future information;translation history;word embedding","","","","48","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results show a significant tendency in the relationship between speaking style and linguistic information. According to the analysis results, a word's acoustic likelihood calculated from the spontaneous speech acoustic model is higher, or more suitable, than that from the read speech acoustic model in the case when the word is an interjection or an auxiliary verb. On the other hand, even in human-to-human conversation, a word's acoustic likelihood calculated from the read speech acoustic model can be higher than that from the spontaneous speech acoustic model in the case when the word is a noun. Applying this knowledge along with machine learning, post-processing experiments of the results of ASR using these two acoustic models are carried out. In this set of experiments, post-processing, based on a support vector machine, is applied. The experimental results show that the selection scheme, based on word category, reduces word error rate by 1.62 points over the single system.","","0-7803-7980-2","10.1109/ASRU.2003.1318464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318464","","Speech analysis;Speech recognition;Automatic speech recognition;Natural languages;Machine learning;Decoding;Laboratories;Acoustical engineering;Information analysis;Support vector machines","speech recognition;support vector machines;natural languages;learning (artificial intelligence);error statistics","support vector machine;speaking style effects;dialogue speech recognition;acoustic likelihood;spontaneous speech acoustic model;read speech acoustic model;linguistic information;word category selection scheme;language likelihood;interjection;auxiliary verb;noun;machine learning;word error rate reduction","","1","","10","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, when a maximum entropy based statistical natural language generation model is used to generate target language sentence as the translation output, serious inflection and synonym issues arise, because the compromised solution is used in semantic representation to avoid the data sparseness problem. We use N-gram models as a postprocessing step to enhance the generation performance.

With this cascade approach, we can exploit large non-paired datasets to independently train state-of-the-art models for each module. However, ASR errors directly affect the performance of the NLP backend in the cascade approach. In this paper, we reduce the impact of ASR errors on the NLP back-end by combining transcriptions from various ASR systems. Recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER) is a widely used technique for system combination. Although ROVER improves ASR performance, the combination process is not optimized for backend tasks. We propose a system combination that resembles ROVER using attention fusion to achieve the alignment and the combination of multiple ASR hypotheses. This allows the combination process to be optimized for the backend NLP task without changing the ASR frontend. Our proposed technique is general and can be applied to various SLP tasks.

The Wards' algorithms, BIRCH, Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to figure out the appropriate sound representation for the given context. To distinguish correct elocution, the SVM procedures are equipped with the principles of pruning. The output was analyzed using divergent stages of uncertainty. In order to study the effect of the output 10 listeners were considered for determining Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio.

The number of individuals using the internet has risen tremendously. Most documents are written in English since that is the most extensively used language on the internet. If a user’s first dialect is Gujarati, he or she will naturally prefer to access the information in Gujarati whenever possible. Even though there are already various MT systems and tools that support Indian languages; however, the translation’s quality is mediocre and might be improved. As observed, when models are trained on limited quantities of parallel data, their performance declines. Learned models often have limited performance (inaccurate translations and feature scores) along with low coverage (high out-of-vocabulary rates). Furthermore, the researchers were driven to present novel methodologies and solutions that would automatically construct Datasets for MT due to the increased demand for effective technologies to process and translate information from/to Gujarati Language. Our objective of generating a Gujarati-English dataset has been met in two ways. We have already introduced GEDset, that is automatic Dataset Builder for Machine Translation System with Specific Reference to Gujarati-English [1]. Here, in this paper we are proposing a model to automatically build Gujarati-English dataset from audio that is available in Gujarati Language through Speech Processing.","2329-7182","978-1-6654-8038-3","10.1109/CSNT54456.2022.9787677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787677","Machine Translation;Speech Processing;Dataset;Machine Learning","Training;Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Conferences;Pipelines;Data models;Machine translation","deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;language translation;natural language processing;speech processing","automated technique;automatic dataset builder;Deep Learning;DsetGenS;GEDset;Gujarati Language;Gujarati-English dataset;Indian languages;Internet;Machine Learning;Machine Translation System;MT technology;parallel data quantities;translation quality","","","","13","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such systems, HMMs (the acoustic models) are integrated into a n-gram or a stochastic finite-state grammar (the language model). Similar models can be used for speech translation, and HMMs (the acoustic models) can be integrated into a finite-state transducer (the translation model). Moreover, the translation process can be performed by searching for an optimal path of states in the integrated network. The output of this search process is a target word sequence associated to the optimal path. In speech translation, HMMs can be trained from a source speech corpus, and the translation model can be learned automatically from a parallel training corpus. This approach has been assessed in the framework of the EUTRANS project, founded by the European Union. Extensive speech-input experiments have been carried out with translations from Spanish to English and from Italian to English translation, in an application involving the interaction (by telephone) of a customer with a receptionist at the front-desk of a hotel.

Although various machine translation methods have been proposed during the past few years, automatic and intelligent quality detection for translation results failed to receive sufficient attention. Actually, the real-time quality evaluation for machine translation results remains important, because it can facilitate constant debugging and optimization of machine translation products. Existing approaches mostly focused on the offline written contents rather than real-time extensive oral contents. To bridge current gap, a sentence-level machine translation quality estimation method is deployed in this paper. In particular, a specifical recurrent neural network with double directions (Double-RNN) is proposed as the backbone network structure. The feature extraction process utilizes the Double-RNN translation model, which makes full use of a large amount of parallel corpus. The evaluations show that Double-RNN method proposed in this paper is the closest to the standard quality assessment, and thus can also evaluate the quality of Chinese and English translations more fairly.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3305397","Teaching Research Division, Wuchang Shouyi University, under the Project of Study on the Teaching Mode of Intercultural Communication Under Outcomes-Based Education(grant numbers:2021Y06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10217819","Quality detection;deep learning;machine translation;complex scenes","Machine translation;Speech recognition;Feature extraction;Linguistics;Web and internet services;Quality assessment;Manuals;Deep learning;Machine translation;Complex systems;Scene classification","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;language translation;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets","active international connections;automatic quality detection;complex scenes-aware machine translation;constant debugging;deep learning-based intelligent quality detection model;Double-RNN method;Double-RNN translation model;feature extraction process;machine translation methods;machine translation products;machine translation results;natural language processing;offline written contents;optimization;real-time extensive oral contents;real-time quality evaluation;sentence-level machine translation quality estimation method;specifical recurrent neural network;standard quality assessment","","","","36","CCBY","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, exploring child speech recognition can also help us improve the current speech recognition systems since on validating it in such a manner that it will be useful for child speech may help the systems work in a good way such that we will be able to validate it for everyone irrespective of the age variation in which a speech utterance is produced.

Therefore, we cascade stochastic source-channel models that extract an underlying message from a corrupt observed output. The three models effectively translate: (1) speech to word lattices (automatic speech recognition, ASR); (2) ill-formed fragments of word strings into a compact well-formed sentence (Clean); (3) sentences in one language to sentences in another (machine translation, MT). We present results of our research efforts towards rapid language portability of all these components. The results on translation suggest that MT systems can be successfully constructed for any language pair by cascading multiple MT systems via English. Moreover, end-to-end performance can be improved, if the interlingua language is enriched with additional linguistic information that can be derived automatically and monolingually in a data-driven fashion.","1520-6149","0-7803-8484-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1326657","","Natural languages;Cleaning;Automatic speech recognition;Surface-mount technology;Speech recognition;Speech enhancement;Interactive systems;Laboratories;Stochastic processes;Lattices","statistical analysis;language translation;speech recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic processes;natural languages","language portability;statistical speech translation;learning approaches;stochastic source-channel models;automatic speech recognition;ASR;statistical machine translation;MT;linguistic information","","2","2","11","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve highly accurate and robust conversational spoken language translation, a unique concept-based speech-to-speech translation approach is proposed that performs the translation by first understanding the meaning of the automatically recognized text. A decision-tree based statistical natural language understanding algorithm extracts the semantic information from the input sentences, while a natural language generation (NLG) algorithm predicts the translated text via maximum-entropy-based statistical models. One critical component in our statistical NLG approach is natural concept generation (NCG). The goal of NCG is not only to generate the correct set of concepts in the target language, but also to produce them in an appropriate order. To improve maximum-entropy-based concept generation, a set of new approaches is proposed. One approach improves concept sequence generation in the target language via forward–backward modeling, which selects the hypothesis with the highest combined conditional probability based on both the forward and backward generation models. This paradigm allows the exploration of both the left and right context information in the source and target languages during concept generation. Another approach selects bilingual features that enable maximum-entropy-based model training on the preannotated parallel corpora. This feature is augmented with word-level information in order to achieve higher NCG accuracy while minimizing the total number of distinct concepts and, hence, greatly reducing the concept annotation and natural language understanding effort. These features are further expanded to multiple sets to enhance model robustness. Finally, a confidence threshold is introduced to alleviate data sparseness problems in our training corpora. Experiments show a dramatic concept generation error rate reduction of more than 40% in our speech translation corpus within limited domains. Significant improvements of both word error rate and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score are also achieved in our experiments on speech-to-speech translation.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597244","Maximum-entropy models;natural concept generation (NCG);speech-to-speech translation;statistical concept-based translation","Entropy;Natural languages;Speech synthesis;Robustness;Error analysis;Prototypes;Speech recognition;Automatic speech recognition;Text recognition;Data mining","","Maximum-entropy models;natural concept generation (NCG);speech-to-speech translation;statistical concept-based translation","","17","4","32","IEEE","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

And it is very convenient to disseminate images in smart mobile devices. The design of mobile learning platform is mainly to facilitate learners to use mobile devices to access the resources on the server through wireless network at any time. The system mainly includes three parts of the learning resource server, wireless network, mobile terminal. In data search, different modes of complete matching and fuzzy matching can be selected, and the fuzzy matching mode is mainly used to improve translation memory. Translation memory is the key feature and core part of automatic translation system. At present, the evaluation of all translation products revolves around a certain fixed standard to evaluate a certain attribute of the product. There is no fixed evaluation standard to evaluate the quality of machine automatic translation. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of machine automatic translation with high accuracy. Therefore, an automatic translation machine speech signal recognition method based on spectrum features is proposed. The frequency spectrum energy function is used to separate the noise characteristic coefficients and adjust the speech signal filter. According to the frequency threshold of core region, the filter parameter correction is determined, and the attenuation coefficient is introduced. Related experiments and simulations show that this newly designed Chinese-English phrase translation combined machine automatic translation system has a higher translation accuracy and recall rate of 11.2%, an error rate of 1.3%, and a strong intelligence improvement of 6.8%.","","978-1-6654-9707-7","10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9985647","Technology English;English Automatic Translation;Translation Algorithms;Mobile Platforms","Software design;Wireless networks;Software algorithms;Semantics;Speech recognition;Mobile handsets;Software","computer aided instruction;fuzzy set theory;language translation;mobile computing;natural language processing;speech processing;speech recognition","automatic translation machine speech signal recognition method;Chinese-English phrase translation combined machine automatic translation system;complete matching;disseminate images;Educator Bruner;fixed evaluation standard;fixed standard;fuzzy matching mode;higher translation accuracy;learning resource server;mobile learning platform;mobile platforms;mobile terminal;people;recall rate;smart mobile devices;teaching activities;technology English automatic translation algorithms;translation memory;translation products;wireless network","","","","24","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Language models play an important role in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems and statistical approaches to machine translation (SMT), in particular when modeling morphologically rich languages. Despite intensive research over more than 20 years, state-of-the-art LVCSR and SMT systems seem to use only one dominant approach: n-gram back-off language models. This talk first reviews the most important approaches to language modeling. I then discuss some of the recent trends and challenges for the future. An interesting alternative to the back-off n-gram approach are the so-called continuous space methods. The basic idea is to perform the probability estimation in a continuous space. By these means better probability estimations of unseen word sequences can be expected. There is also a relative large body of works on adaptive language models. The adaptation can aim to tailor a language model to a particular task or domain, or it can be performed over time. Another very active research area are discriminative language models. Finally, I will review the challenges and benefits of language models trained an very large amounts of training material.","","978-1-4244-5478-5","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373531","","Natural languages;Speech recognition;Surface-mount technology;Vocabulary","estimation theory;language translation;speech recognition","large vocabulary continuous speech recognition;machine translation statistical approach;morphologically rich languages;continuous space methods;discriminative language models;adaptive language models;n-gram back-off language models;probability estimation;word sequences","","2","","","IEEE","8 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because the computational cost increases with the size of the search space for predicting the target words, the translation quality of NMT is constrained by the limited vocabulary. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel dynamic hierarchical decoder for NMT to utilize all of the target words in the training and decoding process. In the proposed model, a target word is represented by two latent attribute vectors rather than a word vector. The model is trained to dynamically put together those words that share similar linguistic attributes. The prediction of a target word is, therefore, turned into the prediction of attribute vectors, where the $\mathrm{softmax}$ functions are performed at the attribute level. This greatly reduces the model size and the decoding time. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the NMT baselines in both Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2019.2941587","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672555); Joint Project of the Science and Technology Development Fund; Macau SAR; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:045/2017/AFJ,6176116608); Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:0101/2019/A2); Multi-year Research Grant from the University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00087-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839081","Latent attribute;limited vocabulary;hierarchical decoder;neural machine translation (NMT)","Vocabulary;Decoding;Computational modeling;Training;Speech processing;Linguistics;Semantics","decoding;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","neural machine translation;target word;translation quality;dynamic hierarchical decoder;decoding process;latent attribute vectors;word vector;attribute level;decoding time;NMT baselines;English-German translation tasks;linguistic attributes","","4","","54","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The AM converts ATC speech into phoneme-based text sequences that the PM then translates into a word-based sequence, which is the ultimate goal of this research. The LM corrects both phoneme- and word-based errors in the decoding results. The AM, including the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), considers the spatial and temporal dependences of the speech features and is trained by the connectionist temporal classification loss. To cope with radio transmission noise and diversity among speakers, a multiscale CNN architecture is proposed to fit the diverse data distributions and improve the performance. Phoneme-to-word translation is addressed via a proposed machine translation PM with an encoder–decoder architecture. RNN-based LMs are trained to consider the code-switching specificity of the ATC speech by building dependences with common words. We validate the proposed approach using large amounts of real Chinese and English ATC recordings and achieve a 3.95% label error rate on Chinese characters and English words, outperforming other popular approaches. The decoding efficiency is also comparable to that of the end-to-end model, and its generalizability is validated on several open corpora, making it suitable for real-time approaches to further support ATC applications, such as ATC prediction and safety checking.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3015830","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)(grant numbers:U1833115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174746","Acoustic model (AM);air traffic control (ATC);machine translation pronunciation model (PM);multiscale CNN (MCNN);multilingual;robust speech recognition","Hidden Markov models;Task analysis;Atmospheric modeling;Speech recognition;Vocabulary;Decoding;Real-time systems","air traffic control;decoding;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","multilingual speech recognition;air traffic control systems;robust speech recognition;single framework;acoustic model;pronunciation model;language model;converts ATC speech;phoneme-based text sequences;word-based sequence;phoneme- word-based errors;decoding results;convolutional neural network;recurrent neural network;spatial dependences;temporal dependences;speech features;connectionist temporal classification loss;radio transmission noise;multiscale CNN architecture;diverse data distributions;phoneme-to-word translation;machine translation PM;encoder-decoder architecture;RNN-based LMs;common words;English words;end-to-end model;support ATC applications;safety checking","Acoustics;Algorithms;Aviation;Computer Systems;Language;Multilingualism;Neural Networks, Computer;Reproducibility of Results;Speech;Speech Recognition Software;Translations","27","","64","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work we improve the recognition performance of such an ASR system on the target language of the human translator by taking advantage of an either written or spoken source language representation. To do so, machine translation techniques are used to translate between the different languages and then the involved ASR systems are biased towards the gained knowledge.

Decoding for ASR, FST-based, and SCFG-based translation is also presented from a unified perspective as different realizations of the generic Viterbi algorithm on graphs or hypergraphs. These consolidated perspectives are helpful to catalyze tighter integrations for improved ST, and we discuss joint decoding and modeling toward coupling ASR and SMT.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2013.2249491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497459","Discriminative training;finite-state transducer (FST);graph;hypergraph;speech translation (ST);statistical machine translation (SMT);synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG);Viterbi search","Speech processing;Information processing;Training;Statistical learning;Viterbi algorithm;Automata;Transducers;Context awareness","graph theory;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);speech coding;speech recognition;statistical analysis;transducers;Viterbi decoding","statistical machine translation;structures;learning;decoding;SMT techniques;speech translation;automatic speech recognition;ASR;finite state transducer;FST;Viterbi algorithm;hypergraphs","","4","","100","IEEE","12 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve the balance for both, the model needs to wait for appropriate streaming text (READ policy) and then generates its translation (WRITE policy). However, WRITE policies of previous work either are specific to the method itself due to the end-to-end training or suffer from the input mismatch between training and decoding for the non-end-to-end training. Therefore, it is essential to learn a generic and better WRITE policy for simultaneous machine translation. Inspired by strategies utilized by human interpreters and ""wait"" policies, we propose a novel adaptive prefix-to-prefix training policy called LEAPT, which allows our machine translation model to learn how to translate source sentence prefixes and make use of the future context.

However, such systems can be used in computer-assisted translation to increase the productivity of the (human) translation process. The idea is to use a text-to-text translation system to produce portions of target language text that can be accepted or amended by a human translator using text or speech. These user-validated portions are then used by the text-to-text translation system to produce further, hopefully improved suggestions. There are different alternatives of using speech in a computer-assisted translation system: From pure dictated translation to simple determination of acceptable partial translations by reading parts of the suggestions made by the system. In all the cases, information from the text to be translated can be used to constrain the speech decoding search space. While pure dictation seems to be among the most attractive settings, unfortunately perfect speech decoding does not seem possible with the current speech processing technology and human error-correcting would still be required. Therefore, approaches that allow for higher speech recognition accuracy by using increasingly constrained models in the speech recognition process are explored here. All these approaches are presented under the statistical framework. Empirical results support the potential usefulness of using speech within the computer-assisted translation paradigm.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.857788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1621206","Computer-assisted translation (CAT);speech recognition;statistical machine translation","Speech recognition;Humans;Speech processing;Productivity;Natural languages;Decoding;Space technology;Computer errors;Error correction","language translation;speech recognition","computer-assisted translation;speech recognition;text-to-text translation;statistical framework","","16","1","37","IEEE","18 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our experimental results show that the maximum-entropy segmentation model significantly improves translation quality in terms of BLEU.

This algorithm utilizes confusion network information to enable phrase-level reordering, and is also able to process general lattices. The proposed search is not constrained to be monotonic; thus, it is able to perform the same type of reordering given lattice input as any statistical phrase-based search algorithm with a single sentence input. Using the concept described in this paper, we are able to significantly improve speech translation results on several small and large vocabulary tasks. The improvements of the MT quality as measured by BLEU are as high as 5% relative.

A most important requirement of AD is isochrony, i.e. dubbed speech has to closely match the timing of speech and pauses of the original audio. In our automatic dubbing system, isochrony is modeled by controlling the verbosity of machine translation; inserting pauses in the translations, a.k.a. prosodic alignment; and controlling the duration of text-to-speech (TTS) utterances. The latter two steps heavily rely on speech duration information, either to predict or control TTS duration. So far, duration prediction was based on a proxy method while duration control on linear warping of the TTS speech spectrogram. In this study, we propose novel duration models for neural TTS that can be leveraged both to predict and control TTS duration. Experimental results show that compared to previous work, the new models improve or match the performance of prosodic alignment and significantly enhance neural TTS speech quality for both slow and fast speaking rates.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9747158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9747158","speech translation;text-to-speech;automatic dubbing;duration modelling","Training;Computational modeling;Force;Pipelines;Predictive models;Speech enhancement;Speech","language translation;natural language processing;neural nets;speech synthesis","duration modeling;viewer experience;automatic dubbing system;isochrony;machine translation;prosodic alignment;text-to-speech utterances;speech duration information;TTS duration;duration prediction;TTS speech spectrogram;neural TTS speech quality;speech translation;verbosity;linear warping;speaking rates","","","","36","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Audio Voice Translation Guide System (Tongues) is a mobile, networked, speech-to-speech machine translation system that both benefits from and contributes to the digitized battlefield. The Tongues prototype runs on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile computing platform, capable of fitting in a cargo pocket, and running a Microsoft Windows operating system. It supports real time interactive translation of bilingual conversation, within and without the selected target domain, with the highest quality appearing within the target domain. Tongues has a modular architecture, allowing for easy upgrades to the speech and language engines and multiple conversational domains and languages. The prototype system supports English/Croatian conversation for deployed US Army chaplains, a domain that includes religious support, humanitarian aid, and operations other than war. The system supports text-entry as well as speech input and provides feedback for verification of translation accuracy. The Tongues system can automatically capture and store textual and audio conversation transcripts in formats that comply with the Joint Technical Architecture-Army (JTA-A). It supports a wide variety of JTA-A compliant means for transferring that information to other information systems. Tongues can run in a stand-alone mode, or it can make a wireless network connection to remote machine translation servers, allowing for increased performance and flexibility.","","0-7803-7225-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985914","","Prototypes;Speech;Natural languages;Peace technology;Mobile communication;Humans;Mobile computing;Military computing;Operating systems;Computer architecture","language translation;natural languages;speech processing;military communication;real-time systems;interactive systems;speech recognition","machine conversation translation;digitized battlefield;military operations;peace-keeping;multinational forces;joint multinational forces;Audio Voice Translation Guide System;Tongues;mobile machine translation system;COTS mobile computing platform;commercial off-the-shelf platform;Microsoft Windows operating system;real time interactive translation;bilingual conversation;modular architecture;speech engine;English/Croatian conversation;language engine;translation accuracy verification;US Army;humanitarian aid;religion;Joint Technical Architecture-Army;JTA-A;voice recognition engine","","1","","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Speech recognition technique is an important research direction in the domain of artificial intelligence, which has high research value and commercial value. The method adopted in this paper is machine learning algorithm, and the deep learning technique among machine learning algorithms is selected. In this paper, the influence of high-order harmonic distortion, high frequency and mixed elements on the quality of speech signals caused by human vocal organs and speech signal acquisition equipment is studied. Windowing and framing are performed, so that the whole speech waveform will be divided into many small speech segments with overlapping 25ms, and then appropriate acoustic feature extraction algorithm is used to extract the corresponding acoustic features from the 25ms speech segments. After research, this method ameliorates the efficiency of speech recognition, which is higher than that of traditional methods.","","979-8-3503-0115-1","10.1109/ACEDPI58926.2023.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158109","Machine learning algorithm;Chinese;Speech intelligibility","Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Training data;Speech recognition;Speech enhancement;Markov processes;Big Data","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;natural language processing;speech intelligibility;speech processing;speech recognition","acoustic feature extraction algorithm;artificial intelligence;chinese speech intelligibility evaluation system;deep learning technique;high-order harmonic distortion;human vocal organs;machine learning algorithm;speech recognition technique;speech signal acquisition;speech waveform","","","","15","IEEE","26 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A few works have been conducted to determine the POS tags for the Tamil words. However, the performance of the POS tagger with unknown words (words that do not appear in the lexicon) is not explored in the literature. The appearance of unknown words is a frequently occurring problem in POS tagging because, in real-world use, the NLP application will encounter words that are not in its lexicon. This paper proposes a deep learning-based POS tagger for the Tamil language using Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM). Our experiments use two corpora, one is AU-KBC annotated corpus, and the other is MeitY corpus. We also analysed the performance of the POS tagger with unknown words. Test results show that the POS tags for Tamil words determined by this approach have 99.8%, 99.5% and 96.5% accuracies for only known words, around 9.8% unknown words and 47.6% unknown words in test sentences respectively.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660738","Part of Speech;Deep Learning;Tamil;BLSTM","Deep learning;Sentiment analysis;Conferences;Speech recognition;Bidirectional control;Tagging;Machine translation","deep learning (artificial intelligence);language translation;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition;text analysis","known words;part of speech tagging;POS tagging;natural language processing applications;speech recognition;Tamil words;deep learning-based POS tagger;Tamil language;NLP;machine translation;sentiment analysis;bi-directional long short term memory;BLSTM;AU-KBC annotated corpus;MeitY corpus","","2","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With resources from top universities like Stanford and MIT, students have access to an immense wealth of educational videos and other material. However, the majority of these resources are in English, creating a language barrier that prevents non-native speakers from utilizing them effectively. In addition, Indic languages have very limited educational resources available online and manual dubbing of videos is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Automated subtitling is not a feasible alternative either, as reading Kannada subtitles alongside English videos can be strenuous. To address these issues, a system is needed that can dub English videos into a specific target language. The focus of this work is on developing such a system for Kannada. The proposed solution is an exhaustive audio-visual system that generates Kannada videos from English videos with accurate lip synchronization, even in dynamic environments, with any kind of face or voice. The system consists of four stages, namely speech-to-text, neural machine translation, text-to-speech, and lip-synchronization. Each component has been evaluated using different metrics, such as Word Error Rate (WER), BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores, and Mean Opinion Score (MOS), based on surveys conducted to test the output. Extensive quantitative evaluations portray that the naturalness of the lip-synced output video is superior to manually dubbed videos, proved by an overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.56. The proposed system has the potential to revolutionize the film industry by replacing the entire manual dubbing process and generating Pan-Global movies. It will also bridge the language gap for people with little or no understanding of English and allow them to access valuable educational resources online in their native language.","2768-5330","979-8-3503-9725-3","10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142578","Dubbing;Lip synchronization;Kannada;Voice cloning;Neural Machine Translation;Automatic Speech Recognition;Text to Speech;Indic languages","Surveys;Lips;Entertainment industry;Speech recognition;Streaming media;Synchronization;Speech synthesis","audio-visual systems;language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition","access valuable educational resources;accurate lip synchronization;educational resources available online;educational videos;English videos;entire manual dubbing process;Kannada subtitles;Kannada videos;lip-synced output video;lip-synchronization;low resource speech-to-speech translation;online education;speech-to-text;text-to-speech","","","","18","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For neural MT, generating translations of length close to the source length (e.g. within ±10% in character count), while preserving quality is a challenging task. Controlling MT output length comes at a cost to translation quality, which is usually mitigated with a two step approach of generating N-best hypotheses and then re-ranking based on length and quality. This work introduces a self-learning approach that allows a transformer model to directly learn to generate outputs that closely match the source length, in short Isometric MT. In particular, our approach does not require to generate multiple hypotheses nor any auxiliary ranking function. We report results on four language pairs (English → French, Italian, German, Spanish) with a publicly available benchmark.

It is a two-pass decoding model decomposing the overall task into ASR and machine translation sub-tasks. However, the decoding speed is not fast enough for real-world applications because it conducts beam search for both sub-tasks during inference. We propose Fast-MD, a fast MD model that generates HI by non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding based on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) outputs followed by an ASR decoder. We investigated two types of NAR HI: (1) parallel HI by using an autoregressive Transformer ASR decoder and (2) masked HI by using Mask-CTC, which combines CTC and the conditional masked language model. To reduce a mismatch in the ASR decoder between teacher-forcing during training and conditioning on CTC outputs during testing, we also propose sampling CTC outputs during training. Experimental evaluations on three corpora show that Fast-MD achieved about 2× and 4× faster decoding speed than that of the naïve MD model on GPU and CPU with comparable translation quality. Adopting the Conformer encoder and intermediate CTC loss further boosts its quality without sacrificing decoding speed.","","978-1-6654-3739-4","10.1109/ASRU51503.2021.9687894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687894","End-to-end speech translation;multi-decoder;non-autoregressive decoding;CTC;Mask-CTC","Training;Bridges;Conferences;Graphics processing units;Transformers;Decoding;Machine translation","autoregressive processes;decoding;deep learning (artificial intelligence);inference mechanisms;language translation;sampling methods;speech recognition","CTC output sampling;masked HI;parallel HI;connectionist temporal classification outputs;ASR decoder;decoding speed;intermediate CTC loss;conditional masked language model;Mask-CTC;autoregressive Transformer ASR decoder;NAR HI;machine translation sub-tasks;intermediate automatic speech recognition decoder states;high translation quality;multidecoder end-to-end speech translation model;nonautoregressive hidden intermediates;Fast-MD","","2","","70","IEEE","3 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on balancing a tradeoff between these two kinds of corpora through the analysis of two newly developed corpora in the travel domain: a bilingual parallel corpus with 420 K utterances and a collection of in-domain dialogs using actual S2ST systems. We found that the first corpus is effective for covering utterances in the second corpus if complimented with a small number of utterances taken from monolingual dialogs. We also found that characteristics of in-domain utterances become closer to those of the first corpus when more restrictive conditions and instructions to speakers are given. These results suggest the possibility of a bootstrap-style of development of corpora and S2ST systems, where an initial S2ST system is developed with parallel texts, and is then gradually improved with in-domain utterances collected by the system as restrictions are relaxed","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2006.878262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677987","Corpus;machine translation;speech translation;spoken dialog","Natural languages;Humans;Speech recognition;Global communication;Strontium;Speech synthesis;Parameter estimation;State estimation;Communications technology;Laboratories","language translation;speech processing","speech-to-speech translation;corpora;dialog speech;bilingual experts;conversational-style texts;travel domain;bilingual parallel corpus;in-domain utterances","","21","","28","IEEE","21 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we manually annotate a monotonic test set based on the MuST-C English-Chinese test set, denoted as SiMuST-C. Our human evaluation confirms the acceptability of our annotated test set. Evaluations on three different SimulMT models verify that the underestimation problem can be alleviated on our test set.

The decoder implements constrained source reordering on the input lattice and makes use of an outbound distortion model to score the possible reorderings. The phrase table, representing the decoding search space, is encoded as a weighted finite state acceptor which is determined and minimized. At a high level, the search proceeds by performing simultaneous transitions in two pairs of automata: (input lattice, phrase table FSM) and (phrase table FSM, target language model). An alternative decoding strategy that we explore is to break the search into two independent subproblems: first, we perform monotone lattice decoding and find the best foreign path through the ASR lattice and then, we decode this path with reordering using standard sentence-based SMT. We report experimental results on several testsets of a large scale Arabic-to-English speech translation task in the context of the global autonomous language exploitation (or GALE) DARPA project. The results indicate that, for monotone search, lattice-based decoding outperforms 1-best decoding whereas for search with reordering, only the second decoding strategy was found to be superior to 1-best decoding. In both cases, the improvements hold only for shallow lattices.","","978-1-4244-1745-2","10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430143","","Viterbi algorithm;Decoding;Lattices;Automatic speech recognition;Surface-mount technology;Large-scale systems;Error analysis;Electronic mail;Automata;Testing","automata theory;language translation;natural language interfaces;speech processing;statistical analysis;Viterbi decoding","lattice-based Viterbi decoding technique;speech translation;statistical phrase-based machine translation;outbound distortion model;weighted finite state acceptor;automata theory;standard sentence-based SMT","","6","","13","IEEE","14 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data collection is expensive and limited by speed of manual transcription. In order to address this, we advocate the use of neural machine translation as a data augmentation technique for bootstrapping language models. Machine translation (MT) offers a systematic way of incorporating collections from mature, resource-rich conversational systems that may be available for a different language. However, ingesting raw translations from a general purpose MT system may not be effective owing to the presence of named entities, intra sentential code-switching and the domain mismatch between the conversational data being translated and the parallel text used for MT training. To circumvent this, we explore following domain adaptation techniques: (a) sentence embedding based data selection for MT training, (b) model finetuning, and (c) rescoring and filtering translated hypotheses. Using Hindi language as the experimental testbed, we supplement transcribed collections with translated US English utterances. We observe a relative word error rate reduction of 7.8-15.6%, depending on the bootstrapping phase. Fine grained analysis reveals that translation particularly aids the interaction scenarios underrepresented in the transcribed data.","","978-1-7281-0306-8","10.1109/ASRU46091.2019.9003982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9003982","speech recognition;neural machine translation;domain adaptation;code-switching","Training;Data models;Adaptation models;Decoding;Buildings;Speech recognition;Architecture","natural language processing;speech recognition;statistical analysis","language model bootstrapping;neural machine translation;conversational speech recognition systems;user-device interactions;data collection;data augmentation technique;language models;resource-rich conversational systems;general purpose MT system;conversational data;domain adaptation techniques;model finetuning;rescoring;filtering translated hypotheses;Hindi language;supplement transcribed collections;translated US English utterances;transcribed data;intrasentential code-switching","","1","","20","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, transcriptions are not always available, and how to improve the ST model performance without transcription, i.e., data efficiency, has rarely been studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Non-parametric Knowledge Distillation (DNKD) from data perspective to improve the data efficiency. Our method follows the knowledge distillation paradigm. However, instead of obtaining the teacher distribution from a sophisticated MT model, we construct it from a non-parametric datastore via k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) retrieval, which removes the dependence on transcription and MT model. Then we decouple the classic knowledge distillation loss into target and non-target distillation to enhance the effect of the knowledge among non-target logits, which is the prominent ""dark knowledge"". Experiments on MuST-C corpus show that, the proposed method can achieve consistent improvement over the strong baseline without requiring any transcription.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096899","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10096899","Speech translation;Knowledge distillation;k-Nearest-Neighbor;Non-parametric","Training;Signal processing;Data models;Acoustics;Machine translation;Speech processing;Task analysis","","","","","","29","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While these work well for training a monolingual model, there are certain limitations when ap-plying these to a multilingual model. Rare characters from character-rich languages like Korean can easily result in large vocabulary size, limiting the model's compactness. Repre-senting text at the level of bytes has also been proposed. However, a byte sequence representation of text is often much longer, which increases the decoding time and makes it computationally expensive for on-device use. Byte-based sub-words (BBPE) are proposed in neural machine translation for word representation but are still unexplored in the ASR domain. In this work, we conduct an empirical study comparing the above three tokenization strategies across three metrics: Word Error Rate (WER), model size, and the decoding time, which are critical for an on-device ASR. We did extensive experiments for both monolingual and bilingual, with languages belonging to same (English and Spanish) and different (English and Korean) language families. Our exper-iments show that BBPE and BPE models yield a similar WER for English and Spanish. While for a character-rich language like Korean, we get 26% and 14% relative WER improvement with BBPE monolingual and bilingual models, respectively. In contrast, the byte models trade-off small model size and a fixed vocabulary at the cost of high xRT. Among all three, we found the BBPE strategy to be the most flexible and optimal for most cases.","","978-1-6654-3739-4","10.1109/ASRU51503.2021.9687921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687921","end-to-end speech recognition;multilin-gual;RNN-Transducer","Training;Measurement;Vocabulary;Limiting;Error analysis;Computational modeling;Tokenization","language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition;vocabulary","decoding time;on-device ASR;Korean;BPE models;character-rich language;bilingual models;byte models;BBPE strategy;different tokenization strategies;streaming End-to-End ASR;End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition models use character-based vocabularies;monolingual model;multilingual model;rare characters;vocabulary size;repre-senting text;byte-based sub-words;word representation;ASR domain","","1","","28","IEEE","3 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A standard approach to adapt interpolated language models to is to optimize the component weights byminimizing the perplexity on supervision data. This is a widely made approximation for language modeling in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. For speech translation tasks, it is unclear whether a strong correlation still exists between perplexity and various forms of error cost functions in recognition and translation stages. The proposed minimum Bayes risk (MBR) based approach provides a flexible framework for unsupervised LM adaptation. It generalizes to a variety of forms of recognition and translation error metrics. LM adaptation is performed at the audio document level using either the character error rate (CER), or translation edit rate (TER) as the cost function. An efficient parameter estimation scheme using the extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithm is proposed. Experimental results on a state-of-the-art speech recognition and translation system are presented.

On the most rudimentary level, machine translation basically conducts mechanical reinstatement of words from one particular language into another, however, this alone rarely yields a good translation because it needs to recognize the closest match between the complete sentence and the target language. Not every term in one language has an equivalent word in another, and many words have many meanings. Unlike our everyday normal phrase-based translation systems, which are usually made up of many small and tiny sub-components that can be tweaked individually, NMT i.e., neural machine translation seeks to design and train a simple, massive, end-to-end neural network system that analyses a sentence and provides an accurate translation for the respective language. Neural Machine translation is a radical newer technique in the field of language translation and localization that trains neural models using deep neural networks and artificial intelligence. The main advantage of this approach is that you can train a single system directly with source and target text. This eliminates the need for special system pipelines required for statistical machine learning.

However, RNNLMs ignore the fact that the meaning of word can vary substantially in different contexts (e.g., for polysemous words).

In this paper we propose a simple back-translation-style data augmentation method for mandarin Chinese polyphone disambiguation, utilizing a large amount of unlabeled text data. Inspired by the back-translation technique proposed in the field of machine translation, we build a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) model to predict the pronunciation of polyphonic character, and a Phoneme-to-Grapheme (P2G) model to predict pronunciation into text. Meanwhile, a window-based matching strategy and a multi-model scoring strategy are proposed to judge the correctness of the pseudo-label. We design a data balance strategy to improve the accuracy of some typical polyphonic characters in the training set with imbalanced distribution or data scarcity.

The existing SLT parallel corpora are indeed orders of magnitude smaller than those available for the closely related tasks of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), which usually comprise tens of millions of instances. To cope with data paucity, in this paper we explore the effectiveness of transfer learning in end-to-end SLT by presenting a multilingual approach to the task. Multilingual solutions are widely studied in MT and usually rely on “target forcing”, in which multilingual parallel data are combined to train a single model by prepending to the input sequences a language token that specifies the target language. However, when tested in speech translation, our experiments show that MT-like target forcing, used as is, is not effective in discriminating among the target languages. Thus, we propose a variant that uses target-language embed-dings to shift the input representations in different portions of the space according to the language, so to better support the production of output in the desired target language. Our experiments on end-to-end SLT from English into six languages show important improvements when translating into similar languages, especially when these are supported by scarce data. Further improvements are obtained when using English ASR data as an additional language (up to +2.5 BLEU points).","","978-1-7281-0306-8","10.1109/ASRU46091.2019.9004003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9004003","deep learning;speech translation;multi-linguality;direct speech-to-text translation","Task analysis;Two dimensional displays;Data models;Computational modeling;Training;Decoding;Training data","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;speech recognition","end-to-end speech translation;end-to-end neural models;spoken language translation;extreme data scarcity conditions;machine translation;MT;data paucity;end-to-end SLT;multilingual approach;multilingual solutions;multilingual parallel data;language token;English ASR data;target language","","9","","47","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is one of the projects that has lately seen a significant improvement in terms of human judgement compared to traditional methods such as phrase-based machine translation (PMT) and statistical machine translation (SMT). Therefore, developments in NMT have an influence on the perceived difficulty of humans. Numerous internet translation and mobile application solutions, such as Google Translate, etc., were created to solve this issue. However, such simple translation methods are not accurate for the parallel MizoEnglish languages.

The output of our system is evaluated against a set of reference sentences and its performance compared to a test set of human-shortened sentences. We show the system is able to perform at close to human performance on this task. Secondly we evaluate the system when used as a preprocessor to two different machine translation systems. We show that we are able to significantly improve the performance of a machine translation (MT) system based on the publicly available GIZA++ software by pre-processing the input, and make a small improvement to the performance of the more capable ATR translation system.","","0-7803-9361-9","10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598816","","Speech;Humans;System testing;Entropy;History;Natural languages;Laboratories;Cities and towns;Software performance;Natural language processing","language translation;maximum entropy methods;natural languages","automatic machine translation system;word deletion task;reference sentences;GIZA++ software;ATR translation system;maximum entropy-based sentence simplifier","","","","14","IEEE","27 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, we present improvements to the prosodic alignment component of our recently introduced dubbing architecture. We present empirical results for four dubbing directions – English to French, Italian, German and Spanish – on a publicly available collection of TED Talks.

While NAR generation can significantly accelerate inference speed for machine translation, the speedup comes at the cost of sacrificed translation accuracy compared to its counterpart, autoregressive (AR) generation. In recent years, many new models and algorithms have been designed/proposed to bridge the accuracy gap between NAR generation and AR generation. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of various non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models from different aspects. Specifically, we categorize the efforts of NAT into several groups, including data manipulation, modeling methods, training criterion, decoding algorithms, and the benefit from pre-trained models. Furthermore, we briefly review other applications of NAR models beyond machine translation, such as grammatical error correction, text summarization, text style transfer, dialogue, semantic parsing, automatic speech recognition, and so on. In addition, we also discuss potential directions for future exploration, including releasing the dependency of KD, reasonable training objectives, pre-training for NAR, and wider applications, etc. We hope this survey can help researchers capture the latest progress in NAR generation, inspire the design of advanced NAR models and algorithms, and enable industry practitioners to choose appropriate solutions for their applications.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3277122","NSFC(grant numbers:62206194); Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129160","Non-autoregressive;neural machine translation;transformer;sequence generation;natural language processing","Training;Decoding;Surveys;Mathematical models;Machine translation;Data models;Computational modeling","inference mechanisms;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;speech recognition;text analysis","advanced NAR models;autoregressive generation;inference speed;machine learning;NAR generation;natural language processing communities;neural machine translation;nonautoregressive generation;nonautoregressive translation models;sacrificed translation accuracy","","4","","242","IEEE","18 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Baseline classifiers, including a zerorule classifier, a random classifier, a frequency classifier, and nonsequential multi-class classifiers are compared to different neural network architectures. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), and a neural machine translation (NMT) outperform the baseline classifiers, suggesting a pattern in the data relating to emotion labels.

The paper describes various types of noises present in there and how these are identified. Different types of noise filters are developed and normalization processes have been applied on the corpora. Statistical and neural machine translation models are trained to study the impact of cleaning of noisy data. We performed experiments with noisy data and with cleaned data after discarding noisy data from the training corpus. Standard test set WMT-14 has been used for performing evaluation. The quality of machine translation has been measured through BLEU scores. It was observed that even after discarding a significant volume of noisy data, the models without noisy data performed better than the corpus containing noises. It proves that quality of data has significant impact and mere having huge piles of uncleaned data in not a good choice. The test case presented here is for English-Hindi language pair. It also shows a path that for low resource language pairs, paying attention to the quality of data would bring returns in form of better translation performance.

Although manual translation can express the original text well, with the increasing number of documents, the speed of manual translation seems to be stretched. Machine translation is an important means to solve this problem. Therefore, this paper studies translation models to improve translation speed and hope to achieve accurate translation. In this paper, an intelligent recognition English translation system is designed for English translation. The system needs to obtain English corpus through data clarity, data processing, etc., and through the ID3 algorithm of decision tree and decision tree tool to process English vocabulary, a pure corpus can be obtained, and It can restore and mark the parts of speech in English sentences to achieve more accurate translation results. After optimizing the data of the English translation model constructed in this paper, the model can store more data and save system disk space.","","978-1-6654-9111-2","10.1109/ICMNWC56175.2022.10031764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10031764","ID3 algorithm;intelligent identification;English translation;data optimization","Wireless communication;Vocabulary;Manuals;Data processing;Data models;Decision trees;Machine translation","decision trees;iterative methods;language translation;natural language processing;storage management;text analysis","data storage;decision tree tool;English corpus;English sentences;English vocabulary;ID3 algorithm;intelligent recognition English translation model;machine translation;parts of speech;scientific document;technical document","","","","11","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system consists of an advanced visual interface (where a deaf person can specify a sequence of signs in sign-writing), a language translator (for generating the sequence of words in Spanish), and finally, a text to speech converter. The visual interface allows a sign sequence to be defined using several sign-writing alternatives. The paper details the process for designing the visual interface proposing solutions for HCI-specific challenges when working with the Deaf (i.e. important difficulties in writing Spanish or limited sign coverage for describing abstract or conceptual ideas). Three strategies were developed and combined for language translation to implement the final version of the language translator module. The summative evaluation, carried out with Deaf from Madrid and Toledo, includes objective measurements from the system and subjective information from questionnaires. The paper also describes the first Spanish-LSE parallel corpus for language processing research focused on specific domains. This corpus includes more than 4000 Spanish sentences translated into LSE. These sentences focused on two restricted domains: the renewal of the identity document and driver’s license.

To bridge the gap between limited support and increasing demand, researchers conducted many experiments and developed valuable tools and techniques to create and process Bangla language materials.

Gesture and human activity recognition both are crucial for detecting the sign language as well as the behavior of an individual. These components are rapidly growing domains, enabling higher automation in households as well as in industries. Since extracting the features from continuous hand movements is complex and traditional sign language recognition gloves are costly, the combination of two deep learning algorithms, CNN and RNN can be used for automated sign language recognition. When both of these algorithms are used accuracy of the system also increases (the estimated accuracy is noted to be 92.4% on dynamic hand gestures studied on most of the available datasets). The system will then be able to translate the recognized sign language to desired text and then to speech for further communication using open-source Text-To-Speech API with python. This type of system has the potential in the future to enable a person to give the presentation or join a video conference in business or educational platform in which image or video-based representation of sign language can be projected as the person is speaking on a real-time basis.

As we know that dependency relation annotation is a kind of syntactic or low shallow semantic annotation, however the present annotation schemes are almost all for text rather than spoken discourses or dialogues. By analysis the online spontaneous chatting data, this paper tries to propose a dependency scheme for spoken discourses. Based on the HIT scheme(Harbin Institute of Technology), we finally proposed 26 kinds of dependencies, where four dependencies are added as “Translocation”, “Repetition”, “Duplication” and “Omission”, and three are modified as “Independent Structure”, “Independent Clause” and “Dependent Clause”. The refined dependency scheme enriches the annotation to Chinese spontaneous speech, which would benefit for speech recognition, semantic comprehension and machine translation.","","978-1-4799-7094-0","10.1109/ICSDA.2014.7051415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051415","dependency grammar;HIT dependency parser;dependency annotation;spontaneous speech","Earth Observing System;Speech;Computers;Integrated circuits","language translation;linguistics;natural language processing;speech recognition","syntactic annotation;dependency scheme;Chinese spontaneous speech;semantic annotation;spoken discourses;dialogues;online spontaneous chatting data;HIT scheme;Harbin Institute of Technology;speech recognition;machine translation","","1","","23","IEEE","2 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users are also limited by the fixed sets of lessons or the curriculum provided by these apps. In this work, we present an app framework which allows users free choice of source and target languages, as well as the flexibility in learning any input word, phrase or sentence of their choice using machine translation, whose performance and coverage of new languages is continuously improving. The app provides real-time feedback on the correctness of user pronunciation for any input using a text-based similarity metric, and helps learners practice their pronunciation until they perfect it. The app also provides a conversation platform where intermediate and advanced learners can engage in simple, real-time conversations with a chatbot on topics they are most likely to engage in while learning a new language. The conversation platform uses machine translation and speech-to-text tools to convert user query in any source language into an English query, gets the chatbot response and converts it back to the source language. This simple and novel approach allows users to freely converse in any language they want to practice, while having the chatbot trained only on English language-based corpus. The chatbot also integrates a novel intent classification module that classifies user query into one of several available topics, thereby enabling the chatbot to continue conversation with the user in the same topic. Finally, the chatbot is also capable of integrating search capability for specific queries (e.g., weather) with the help of available public domain resources so that it can provide users with real-time updates for such queries, thus making language learning fun and interesting.","","978-1-6654-1796-9","10.1109/CISS53076.2022.9751168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751168","language learning;machine learning;machine translation;chatbot systems;intent classification;integrated search;speech-to-text;text-to-speech","Measurement;Machine learning;Chatbots;Real-time systems;Machine translation;Meteorology","computer aided instruction;interactive systems;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);linguistics;mobile computing;natural language interfaces;natural language processing;pattern classification;query processing","user query;source language;chatbot;English language-based;language learning fun;machine learning;languages users;target language;app framework;users free choice;target languages;user pronunciation;conversation platform","","1","","15","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An unsupervised expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is typically used to obtain a word alignment from parallel corpora. Being statistically-driven, the alignments produced by this technique are often erroneous. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised boosting strategy for refining automatic word alignment with the goal of improving SMT performance. The proposed approach results in fewer unaligned words, a significant reduction in the number of extracted translation phrase pairs, a corresponding improvement in SMT decoding speed, and a consistent improvement in translation accuracy, as measured by BLEU, across multiple language pairs and test sets. The reduction in storage and processing requirements coupled with improved accuracy make the proposed technique ideally suited for interactive translation services, facilitating applications such as mobile speech-to-speech translation.","","978-1-4244-7902-3","10.1109/SLT.2010.5700847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5700847","word alignment;boosting;statistical machine translation;mobile speech-to-speech translation","Boosting;Decoding;Viterbi algorithm;Training;Accuracy;Mathematical model;Equations","language translation;speech processing;statistical analysis;unsupervised learning","unsupervised boosting technique;translation rules extraction;automatic word alignment;statistical machine translation;SMT;unsupervised expectation-maximization;EM;parallel corpora;interactive translation services;speech-to-speech translation;word alignment refinement","","1","1","10","IEEE","24 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, measuring the similarity of domains is an important task to select appropriate training data. The most widely used method uses the cosine similarity function and word frequency. The lack of exploring other approaches motivates us to propose and compare several similarity measures. Aiming for better SMT performance, we compared 10 similarity measures, which are a combination of 2 feature representations and 5 similarity functions.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that a high quality end-to-end ST model can be trained using only weakly supervised datasets, and that synthetic data sourced from unlabeled monolingual text or speech can be used to improve performance.

We propose a novel approach that only uses monolingual data for code-switch second-pass speech recognition which is also named language model rescoring. The approach converts the code-switch sentence to a monolingual sentence by a word mapping and language model determination step, therefore the issue of data scarcity is unnecessary to be considered. The word pairs during the word mapping step are generated by a fine-designed generation process that incorporates machine translation, word alignment, etc. We show that the proposed approach achieves an over 7.23% relative WER reduction from the naive monolingual language model (MLM) rescoring in our test set.","2379-190X","978-1-7281-7605-5","10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9414158","code-switch;speech recognition;language model rescoring;word mapping;language model determination","Speech coding;Conferences;Speech recognition;Syntactics;Signal processing;Linguistics;Data models","language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition","code-switch speech recognition;data scarcity;monolingual data;code-switch second-pass speech recognition;code-switch sentence;naive monolingual language model rescoring;code-switch speech rescoring;automatic speech recognition system","","1","","19","IEEE","13 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From an ASR evaluation perspective, this means that there is no clear gold standard for the expected output, and several possible outputs could be considered correct according to different human annotators, which makes standard word error rate (WER) inadequate as an evaluation metric. Such a situation is typical for machine translation (MT), and thus we borrow ideas from an MT evaluation metric, namely TERp, an extension of translation error rate which is closely-related to WER. In particular, in the process of comparing a hypothesis to a reference, we make use of spelling variants for words and phrases, which we mine from Twitter in an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments with evaluating ASR output for Egyptian Arabic, and further manual analysis, show that the resulting WERd (i.e., WER for dialects) metric, a variant of TERp, is more adequate than WER for evaluating dialectal ASR.","","978-1-5090-4788-8","10.1109/ASRU.2017.8268928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268928","Automatic speech recognition;dialectal ASR;ASR evaluation;word error rate;multi-reference WER","Speech;Measurement;Standards;Training;Error analysis;Twitter","language translation;natural language processing;social networking (online);speech recognition","translation error rate;WER;dialectal speech recognition;automatic speech recognition systems;dialectal speech input;machine translation","","3","","35","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, there is a considerable modality gap between the semantic-related images and texts in terms of data form and semantic expression. How to fully incorporate visual information into texts to enhance the performance of machine translation is one of the critical issues for MNMT. However, the initial visual and textual features are generally extracted with their modality-specific models; Consequently, there is a considerable representation gap between images and texts. Most previous MNMT works prefer only to adopt the feature-level fusion strategies to learn multi-modal representation, while the modality representation gap is often ignored. To this end, this article proposes a progressive multi-modal Transformer (ProMul-Trans) with Modality Difference-Aware (MDA) to address the visual-to-textual fusion problem raised in MNMT. We first employ MDA to capture the modality-consistency information by taking visual and textual representations as inputs in each Transformer layer. Then a layer-level progressive fusion (Layer-ProFusion) strategy is adopted to progressively align visual and textual representations layer-by-layer to enhance machine translation performance. Experiment results on the Multi30 k dataset are conducted, and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the compared state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on English $\to$ German (En $\to$ De), English $\to$ French (En $\to$ Fr) and English $\to$ Czech (En $\to$ Cs) tasks.

Statistical machine translation has been the dominant approach to MT for decades, but recently neural machine translation achieves increasing interest because of its appealing model architecture and impressive translation performance. In neural machine translation, an attention model is used to identify the aligned source words for the next target word, i.e., target foresight word, to select translation context. However, it does not make use of any information about this target foresight word at all. Previous work proposed an approach to improve the attention model by explicitly accessing this target foresight word and demonstrating substantial alignment tasks. However, this approach cannot be applied in machine translation tasks where the target foresight word is unavailable. This paper proposes several novel enhanced attention models by introducing hidden information (such as part-of-speech) of the target foresight word for the translation task. We incorporate the novel enhanced attention employing hidden information about the target foresight word into both recurrent and self-attention-based neural translation models and theoretically justify that such hidden information can make translation prediction easier.

Conventional automatic MT evaluation methods include BLEU, which MT researchers have frequently used. However, BLEU has two drawbacks in SSMT evaluation. First, BLEU assesses errors lightly at the beginning of translations and heavily in the middle, even though its assessments should be independent of position. Second, BLEU lacks tolerance in accepting colloquial sentences with small errors, although such errors do not prevent us from continuing an SSMT-mediated conversation. In this paper, the authors report a new evaluation method called “g Rader based on Edit Distances (RED)” that automatically grades each MT output by using a decision tree (DT). The DT is learned from training data that are encoded by using multiple edit distances, that is, normal edit distance (ED) defined by insertion, deletion, and replacement, as well as its extensions. The use of multiple edit distances allows more tolerance than either ED or BLEU. Each evaluated MT output is assigned a grade by using the DT. RED and BLEU were compared for the task of evaluating MT systems of varying quality on ATR's Basic Travel Expression Corpus (BTEC). Experimental results show that RED significantly outperforms BLEU.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597245","BLEU;decision tree (DT);edit distances (EDs);machine translation evaluation;mWER;reference translations","Humans;Natural languages;Decision trees;Laboratories;Training data;Mobile communication;Informatics;Resource management;Speech processing","","BLEU;decision tree (DT);edit distances (EDs);machine translation evaluation;mWER;reference translations","","3","","34","IEEE","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

FDA increase the diversity of the selected training set by devaluing features (i.e., n-grams) that have already been included. FDA5 decides which instances to select based on three functions used for initializing and decaying feature values and scaling sentence scores controlled with five parameters. We present optimization techniques that allow FDA5 to adapt these functions to in-domain and out-of-domain translation tasks for different language pairs. In a transductive learning setting, selection of training instances relevant to the test set can improve the final translation quality. In machine translation experiments performed on the 2 million sentence English-German section of the Europarl corpus, we show that a subset of the training set selected by FDA5 can gain up to 3.22 BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can gain up to 0.41 BLEU points compared to using all of the available training data using only 15% of it, and can reach within 0.5 BLEU points to the full training set result by using only 2.7% of the full training data. FDA5 peaks at around 8M words or 15% of the full training set. In an active learning setting, FDA5 minimizes the human effort by identifying the most informative sentences for translation and FDA gains up to 0.45 BLEU points using 3/5 of the available training data compared to using all of it and 1.12 BLEU points compared to random training set. In translation tasks involving English and Turkish, a morphologically rich language, FDA5 can gain up to 11.52 BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can achieve the same BLEU score using as little as 4% of the data compared to random instance selection, and can exceed the full dataset result by 0.78 BLEU points.

In this paper, partially inspired by the idea of segmenting a long sentence into short clauses, each of which can be easily translated by NMT, we propose a hierarchy-to-sequence attentional NMT model to handle these two challenges. Our encoder takes the segmented clause sequence as input and explores a hierarchical neural network structure to model words, clauses, and sentences at different levels, particularly with two layers of recurrent neural networks modeling semantic compositionality at the word and clause level. Correspondingly, the decoder sequentially translates segmented clauses and simultaneously applies two types of attention models to capture contexts of interclause and intraclause for translation prediction. In this way, we can not only improve parameter learning, but also well explore different scopes of contexts for translation.

However, the latency of MMA is still a major issue in ASR and should be combined with a technique that can reduce the test latency at inference time, such as head-synchronous beam search decoding, which forces all non-activated heads to activate after a small fixed delay from the first head activation. In this paper, we remove the discrepancy between training and test phases by considering, in the training of MMA, the interactions across multiple heads that will occur in the test time. Specifically, we derive the expected alignments from monotonic attention by considering the boundaries of other heads and reflect them in the learning process. We validate our proposed method on the two standard benchmark datasets for ASR and show that our approach, MMA with the mutually-constrained heads from the training stage, provides better performance than baselines.","2379-190X","978-1-7281-7605-5","10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9413862","National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9413862","Online Speech Recognition;Transformer;Monotonic Multihead Attention;Head-Synchronous Beam Search Decoding","Training;Signal processing;Magnetic heads;Real-time systems;Decoding;Acoustic beams;Machine translation","decoding;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;speech recognition;video signal processing","Monotonic multihead Attention;online ASR;real-time decoding;Monotonic Multihead Attention;MMA;state-of-the-art offline methods;machine translation;automatic speech recognition tasks;inference time;head-synchronous beam search decoding;head activation;multiple heads;monotonic attention","","1","","24","IEEE","13 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, Transformers have achieved great progress in neural language processing while they are rarely utilized in the field of zero-resource translation with image pivot.

We pay particular attention to two evaluation aspects: i) the design of a sound experimental protocol to reduce the risk of collecting biased measurements, and ii) the use of robust statistical testing methods (linear mixed-effects models) to reduce the risk of under/over-estimating the observed variations. Our adaptive MT technology is integrated in a web-based full-fledged computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool. We report on a post-editing field test that involved 16 professional translators working on two translation directions (English-Italian and English-French), with texts coming from two linguistic domains (legal, information technology). Our contrastive experiments compare user post-editing effort with static vs. adaptive MT in an end-to-end scenario where the system is evaluated as a whole. Our results evidence that adaptive MT leads to an overall reduction in post-editing effort (HTER) up to 10.6% (p <; 0.05). A follow-up manual evaluation of the MT outputs and their corresponding post-edits confirms that the gain in HTER corresponds to higher quality of the adaptive MT system and does not come at the expense of the final human translation quality. Indeed, adaptive MT shows to return better suggestions than static MT (p <; 0.01), and the resulting post-edits do not significantly differ in the two conditions.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2015.2509241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358024","Computer-assisted translation;domain adaptation;human in the loop evaluation;machine translation;online adaptation;post-editing","Adaptation models;Data models;Adaptive systems;Terminology;IEEE transactions;Speech;Speech processing","Internet;language translation","adaptive machine translation;human post-editing;MT technologies;Web-based full-fledged computer-assisted translation;CAT tool;human translation quality","","10","","57","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The units and the locations of the switches may vary widely from single-word switches to whole phrases (beyond the length of the loanword units). Such phenomena pose challenges for spoken language technologies, i.e., automatic speech recognition (ASR), since the systems need to be able to handle the input in a multilingual setting. Several works constructed a CS ASR on many different language pairs. But the common aim of developing a CS ASR is merely for transcribing CS-speech utterances into CS-text sentences within a single individual. In contrast, in this study, we address the situational context that happens during dialogs between CS and non-CS (monolingual) speakers and support monolingual speakers who want to understand CS speakers. We construct a system that recognizes and translates from codeswitching speech to monolingual text. We investigated several approaches, including a cascade of ASR and a neural machine translation (NMT), a cascade of ASR and a deep bidirectional language model (BERT), an ASR that directly outputs monolingual transcriptions from CS speech, and multi-task learning. Finally, we evaluate and discuss these four ways on a Japanese- English CS to English monolingual task.","2472-7695","978-1-7281-2449-0","10.1109/O-COCOSDA46868.2019.9060847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060847","code-switching;speech recognition;speech andtext translation;BERT;multi-task learning","","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;speaker recognition;speech recognition;text analysis","code-switching speech utterances;single-word switches;multi-task learning;monolingual speakers;bilingual communities;English CS;deep bidirectional language model;neural machine translation;monolingual text;CS speakers;CS-text sentences;CS-speech utterances;CS ASR;automatic speech recognition;spoken language technologies;loanword units","","1","","","IEEE","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-source translation is an approach that attempts to resolve these ambiguities by exploiting multiple inputs (e.g. sentences in three different languages) to increase translation accuracy. These methods are trained on multilingual corpora, which include the multiple source languages and the target language, and then at test time uses information from both source languages while generating the target. While there are many of these multilingual corpora, such as multilingual translations of TED talks or European parliament proceedings, in practice, many multilingual corpora are not complete due to the difficulty to provide translations in all of the relevant languages. Existing studies on multi-source translation did not explicitly handle such situations, and thus are only applicable to complete corpora that have all of the languages of interest, severely limiting their practical applicability. In this article, we examine approaches for multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) that can learn from and translate such incomplete corpora. Specifically, we propose methods to deal with incomplete corpora at both training time and test time. For training time, we examine two methods: (1) a simple method that simply replaces missing source translations with a special NULL symbol, and (2) a data augmentation approach that fills in incomplete parts with source translations created from multi-source NMT. For test-time, we examine methods that use multi-source translation even when only a single source is provided by first translating into an additional auxiliary language using standard NMT, then using multi-source translation on the original source and this generated auxiliary language sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed training-time and test-time methods both significantly improve translation performance.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2019.2959224","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP16H05873,JP17H06101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930957","Neural machine translation (NMT);multi-linguality;data augmentation","Training;Decoding;Standards;Speech processing;Europe;Probability;Training data","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets","multilingual translations;multilingual corpora;multisource neural machine translation;incomplete corpora;training time;source translations;multisource NMT;test-time;translation performance;machine-learning methods;translation accuracy;multiple source languages;missing data;word ordering;word choice;missing source translations;NULL symbol","","9","","27","IEEE","11 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, STER extends TER in two ways: first, by incorporating word equivalence measures (WordNet and Porter stemming) standardly used by METEOR, and second, by disallowing alignments of concept words to non-concept words (aka stop words). We show how these features make STER alignments better suited for human-driven analysis than standard TER. We also present experimental results that show that STER is better correlated to human judgments than TER. Finally, we compare STER to METEOR, and illustrate that METEOR scores computed using the STER alignments have similar statistical properties to METEOR scores computed using METEOR alignments.","","978-1-4244-1745-2","10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430144","Automated Metric;Statistical Machine Translation","Error analysis;Humans;Costs;Natural languages;Surface-mount technology;Information technology;Web sites;Globalization;Investments;Information analysis","error statistics;language translation;performance evaluation;software metrics","semantic translation error rate;translation systems evaluation;machine translation systems;word equivalence measures;WordNet;Porter stemming;STER alignments;human-driven analysis;METEOR","","3","","10","IEEE","14 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning such models requires annotated corpora, and porting to different languages would require corpora with parallel text translation and semantic annotations. In this paper we investigate how to learn a SLU model in a target language starting from no target text and no semantic annotation. Our proposed algorithm is based on the idea of exploiting the diversity (with regard to performance and coverage) of multiple translation systems to transfer statistically stable word-to-concept mappings in the case of the romance language pair, French and Spanish. Each translation system performs differently at the lexical level (wrt BLEU). The best translation system performances for the semantic task are gained from their combination at different stages of the portability methodology. We have evaluated the portability algorithms on the French MEDIA corpus, using French as the source language and Spanish as the target language. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed methods with respect to the source language SLU baseline.","","978-1-4673-5126-3","10.1109/SLT.2012.6424221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6424221","Spoken Language Understanding;Statistical Models;Language Portability","Semantics;Media;Speech;Training;Speech recognition;Stochastic processes;Automata","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","spoken language understanding portability;multiple translation systems;SLU model learning problem;annotated corpora;parallel text translation;semantic annotations;statistically stable word-to-concept mappings;romance language pair;French language;Spanish language;translation system performances;portability algorithms;French MEDIA corpus;target languages","","6","","12","IEEE","31 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, our goal is to insert a predefined target keyword into the translation of the adversarial sentence while maintaining similarity between the original sentence and the perturbed one in the source domain. To this aim, we propose an optimization problem, including an adversarial loss term and a similarity term. We use gradient projection in the embedding space to craft an adversarial sentence. Experimental results show that our attack outperforms Seq2Sick, the other targeted adversarial attack against NMT models, in terms of success rate and decrease in translation quality. Our attack succeeds in inserting a keyword into the translation for more than 75% of sentences while similarity with the original sentence stays preserved1.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10095342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10095342","Adversarial attack;deep neural network;natural language processing;neural machine translation;targeted attack","Perturbation methods;Force;Signal processing;Acoustics;Machine translation;Iterative methods;Task analysis","","","","","","22","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most undesired phenomena is lexical gap. A lexical gap occurs in case of lacking Vietnamese equivalent word to English word. There are some approaches to this obstacle. Some researchers prefer replacing lexical gap by its nearest meaning word. However, in out project there isn't a conception database for Vietnamese word that helps to find acceptable word to lexical gap. Our approach for lexical gap establishes a word - to - phrase model for EVMT. Naive replacements of word by phrase keep semantic information as much as possible, however, lead translated sentences to syntactic mismatch, and therefore ungrammatical text. We restructure target sentence using phrase in dictionary as template of formal phrase structure in the model with some algorithms to keep target sentence be grammatical. This approach improves rule - based English Vietnamese machine translation.","","978-1-4244-9063-9","10.1109/IALP.2010.76","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5681570","English - Vietnamese machine translation;lexical gap","Dictionaries;Syntactics;Grammar;Databases;Cities and towns;Speech;Semantics","dictionaries;language translation;natural language processing;text analysis;word processing","lexical gap;English-Vietnamese machine translation;Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology;malfunction system;Vietnamese equivalent word;English word;nearest meaning word;conception database;acceptable word;word to phrase model;EVMT;naive replacement;semantic information;translated sentence;syntactic mismatch;ungrammatical text;target sentence restructure;dictionary phrase;formal phrase structure","","2","","15","IEEE","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regression and classification models were learnt and a score combination strategy was used to predict the rank among the k-best list. Regression models with pairwise features give a bigger gain over other model and feature constructions. Groupwise learning is robust to sentences with different ASR-confidence.

The used ASR and MT systems are then recursively biased towards the gained knowledge. In the case of a written source language representation we are able to reduce the word error rate of our English baseline system by 35.8% relative. In case of a spoken source language representation we are able to reduce the word error rate by 29.9% relative for English and 20.9% relative for Spanish","2158-8481","1-4244-0087-2","10.1109/MELCON.2006.1653325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1653325","","Speech recognition;Humans;Natural languages;Automatic speech recognition;Error analysis;Vocabulary;Interactive systems;Laboratories;Decoding","iterative methods;language translation;speaker recognition","speech recognition;human mediated translation scenarios;human interpreter;English;human translator;spoken source language representation;Spanish;machine translation techniques;iterative system design;target language resources","","2","","7","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though capable and easy to use, they require that the entirety of the input sequence is available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not valid for instantaneous translation and speech recognition. To address this problem, we present a new method for solving sequence-to-sequence problems using hard online alignments instead of soft offline alignments. The online alignments model is able to start producing outputs without the need to first process the entire input sequence. A highly accurate online sequence-to-sequence model is useful because it can be used to build an accurate voice-based instantaneous translator. Our model uses hard binary stochastic decisions to select the timesteps at which outputs will be produced. The model is trained to produce these stochastic decisions using a standard policy gradient method. In our experiments, we show that this model achieves encouraging performance on TIMIT and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech recognition datasets.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-4117-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7952667","Automatic Speech Recognition;End-to-End Speech Recognition;Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","Mathematical model;Speech recognition;Predictive models;Entropy;Stochastic processes;Training;Computational modeling","decision theory;gradient methods;language translation;speech recognition;stochastic processes","continuous rewards policy gradient method;machine translation;instantaneous translation;hard online alignments;online sequence-to-sequence model;voice-based instantaneous translator;hard binary stochastic decisions;TIMIT speech recognition datasets;Wall Street Journal speech recognition datasets","","11","1","25","IEEE","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Language of uttered speech can easily be identified by extracting the language specific information from it. Identification of language of speech is known as Language Identification (LID). Identification of language from speech is helpful in its translation, speech recognition and speech activated automatic systems. LID system may also play an important role in speaker recognition as identification of language can be used to reduce search space. In this paper an approach based on Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features for language identification is proposed using SVM and Random Forest (RF) classification techniques. Both LPC and MFCC features are vocal tract features. LPC and MFCC features extracted from uttered speech contain language as well as speaker related informations. Identification of language highly depends upon extraction of language specific features. Both these vocal tract parameters of speech contain lot of information about languages spoken compared to other parameters like excitation source parameters and prosodic parameters. Hence combination of these features performs better than individual. Experiments have been performed on the database obtained from IIIT-Hyderabad consisting of 5000 multilingual clean speech signals (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi and Malayalam). For training the proposed model, 600 speech signals are taken arbitrarily from the above database. Language model are created for each language. Evaluation of the proposed models has been made using other 300 speech signals from same database. Language models are evaluated using individual features as well as combined features. Experiments performed by taking both features at a time give better result as compared to taking individual features one at a time. Using these features, the accuracy of language identification is not more than 80% so far as claimed by other researchers. In the proposed approach, the accuracy of language identification is improved to 92.6% using combination of same features and random forest model.","","978-1-5090-4426-9","10.1109/ICPCES.2017.8117624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117624","MFCCs;SVM;LPC;Random Forest(RF)","Speech;Support vector machines;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Feature extraction;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Training","cepstral analysis;encoding;feature extraction;linear predictive coding;natural language processing;signal classification;speaker recognition;speech recognition;support vector machines","language specific information;speech recognition;MFCC;speech signals;language identification system;speech activated automatic systems;linear predictive coding;LPC;mel frequency cepstral coefficients;SVM;random forest classification;RF classification;support vector machine;LID","","9","","14","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed statistical transformation model is designed for modeling characteristic linguistic phenomena in spontaneous speech and estimating their occurrence probabilities. These contextual patterns and probabilities are derived from a small amount of parallel aligned corpus of the faithful transcripts and their document-style texts. To realize wide coverage and reliable estimation, a model based on part-of-speech (POS) is also prepared to provide a back-off scheme from a word-based model.

Since the conversion relates to the phonetic aspect of a text, syllabification is considered a major factor affecting the performance of a transliteration system. In grapheme-based approaches, there are two routines to transliterate, one is to perform in a pipeline of separate syllabification and other components in generation process step by step, the other is to synchronously segment syllables and generating transliteration options. Usually, joint decoding outperforms the cascade processing in many natural language processing missions, however, syllabification is a special component in transliteration task. Thus in this paper, we investigate the two routines with a systematic analysis and compare their results to illustrate the strength of syllabification.

When a word is transliterated, it is shifted from one script to another. In contrast to a translation, which clarifies the meaning of a word written in a different language, a transliteration only conveys the word's pronunciation by utilizing a familiar alphabet. This paper proposes a technique for creating a bilingual automated tool to type Sanskrit using English orthography/alphabets and converting Sanskrit text into the script of English which helps in reading the Sanskrit text for those who are not aware about the orthography of Sanskrit language. The system receives input via the QWERTY keyboard, which produces the equivalent Sanskrit text and inversely user can give Sanskrit text as input to get equivalent text using the script of English language. The goal is to create an easy-to-use and robust automated solution that allows end-users to effortlessly type Sanskrit shlokas or sentences using an English keyboard. The suggested approach is unique in that it is based on the language's Unicode and works for the low-resource ancient language Sanskrit. The primary applications of the designed tool are to help user to read Sanskrit text using the script/orthography of English, to create parallel corpora for the Sanskrit language translation process, to create e-versions of manuscripts written in Sanskrit language as the majority of ancient knowledge is not available on the internet, and to make it easy to learn Sanskrit language by any individual or students at the school level.

Once units are obtained, an encoder-decoder architecture is trained to predict them. Then a vocoder generates speech from units.

Then we translated the English phrases into Japanese-phrases by hand semi-automatically. These phrase pairs of source and target language are used to learn an SMT model for domain adaptation. An adaptation method directly inserts these phrase pairs into a phrase table or adds them to a parallel corpus. In the experiments, n-gram and syntax tree based methods are compared whilst extracting frequent English-phrases. Furthermore, the adapted phrase table and the parallel corpus are compared. When the frequent English and Japanese phrase pairs based on syntax tree were added to the phrase table, the baseline model was improved.","","978-9-8814-7682-1","10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820896","","Adaptation models;Speech;Syntactics;Data models;Acoustics;Speech recognition;Mathematical model","natural language processing;neural nets;speech recognition","domain adaptation;speech translation system;parallel phrases in-domain;automatic speech recognition system;deep neural network;phrase-based statistical machine translation system;n-gram methods;syntax tree based methods","","1","","13","","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We instead view the problem from a ranking perspective that naturally allows the consideration of an entire list of candidates as a whole through the adoption of a listwise ranking function. Our shift from a pointwise to a listwise perspective proves to be a simple yet powerful extension to current modeling that allows arbitrary pairwise functions to be incorporated as features, whose weights can be estimated jointly with traditional ones. We further demonstrate that our formulation encompasses the minimum Bayes risk (MBR) approach, another decision rule that considers restricted listwise information, as a special case.

For translation, it simplifies any form (i.e. simple, complex, compound, active and passive form) of English sentence into the simplest form of English sentence i.e. subject plus verb plus object. When compared with existing rule based EtoB MT schemes, VBMT doesn't employ exclusive or individual structural rules of various English sentences; it only detects the main verb from any form of English sentence and then transforms it into the simplest form of English sentence. Thus VBMT can translate from EtoB very simply, correctly and efficiently. Rule based EtoB MT is tough because it requires the matching of sentences with the stored rules. Moreover, many existing EtoB MT schemes which deploy rules are almost inefficient to translate complex or complicated sentences because it is difficult to match them with well-established rules of English grammar. VBMT is efficient because after identifying the main verb of any form of English sentence, it binds the remaining parts of speech (POS) as subject and object. VBMT has been successfully implemented for the MT of Assertive, Interrogative, Imperative, Exclamatory, Active-Passive, Simple, Complex, and Compound form of English sentences applicable in both desktop and mobile applications.","","978-1-4799-5180-2","10.1109/ICIEV.2014.6850684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6850684","Rule based Machine Translation;Natural Language Processing;English to Bangla;Human Language Technology","Tagging;Compounds;Informatics;Conferences;Natural languages;Knowledge based systems;Databases","language translation;natural language processing","English to Bangla machine translation;VBMT;verb based machine translation;EtoB MT schemes;natural language processing;human language technology","","11","","18","IEEE","10 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And the problems of long-distance reordering and translation errors can be partly solved. Meanwhile, the interference between reordering rules of this method has been significantly reduced in this method.

Particularly in N-best list rescoring processing, generalizing N-best lists consisting of as many as candidates from a decoding lattice requires proper utterance segmentation. In lecture speech recognition, only long audio recordings are provided without any utterance segmentation information. In addition, rather than only speech event, other acoustic events, e.g., laugh, applause, etc., are included in the recordings. Traditional speech segmentation algorithms for ASR focus on acoustic cues in segmentation, while in MT, speech text segmentation algorithms pay much attention to linguistic cues. In this study, we propose a three-stage speech segmentation framework by integrating both the acoustic and linguistic cues. We tested the segmentation framework for lecture speech recognition.

We mapped the pronunciation problem into a sequence-to-sequence problem and used two `Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network's (GRU-RNNs) for our model.

Our dedicated probing tasks show that 1) both the absolute position and relative position information gets gradually weakened or even vanished once it reaches the upper encoder layers, and 2) the vanishing of absolute position information in encoder output causes the training failure of Doc2Doc NMT. To alleviate this problem, we propose a position-aware Transformer (P-Transformer) to enhance both the absolute and relative position information in both self-attention and cross-attention. Specifically, we integrate absolute positional information, i.e., position embeddings, into the query-key pairs both in self-attention and cross-attention through a simple yet effective addition operation. Moreover, we also integrate relative position encoding in self-attention. The proposed P-Transformer utilizes sinusoidal position encoding and does not require any task-specified position embedding, segment embedding, or attention mechanism. Through the above methods, we build a Doc2Doc NMT model with P-Transformer, which ingests the source document and completely generates the target document in a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) way. In addition, P-Transformer can be applied to seq2seq-based document-to-sentence (Doc2Sent) and sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) translations. Extensive experimental results of Doc2Doc NMT show that P-Transformer significantly outperforms strong baselines on the widely-used 9 document-level datasets in 7 language pairs, covering small-, middle-, and large-scales, and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Experimentation on discourse phenomena shows that our Doc2Doc NMT models improve the translation quality in both BLEU and discourse coherence.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the robustness of current text adversarial attacks to round-trip translation. We demonstrate that 6 state-of-the-art text-based adversarial attacks do not maintain their efficacy after round-trip translation. Furthermore, we introduce an intervention-based solution1 to this problem, by integrating Machine Translation into the process of adversarial example generation and demonstrating increased robustness to round-trip translation.

Constrained by limited hardware resources and battery, the performance of on-device NMT systems is far from satisfactory. Inspired by conditional computation, we propose to improve the performance of on-device NMT systems with dynamic multi-branch layers. Specifically, we design a layer-wise dynamic multi-branch network with only one branch activated during training and inference. As not all branches are activated during training, we propose shared-private reparameterization to ensure sufficient training for each branch. At almost the same computational cost, our method achieves improvements of up to 1.7 BLEU points on the WMT14 English-German translation task and 1.8 BLEU points on the WMT20 Chinese-English translation task over the Transformer model, respectively. Compared with a strong baseline that also uses multiple branches, the proposed method is up to 1.5 times faster with the same number of parameters.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3153257","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1005103); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62006138,61925601,61772302); Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9729651","Conditional computation;decoding;machine translation;natural language processing;transformers","Training;Performance evaluation;Transformers;Market research;Mobile handsets;Hardware;Machine translation","language translation;mobile computing;natural language processing;neural nets","shared-private reparameterization;artificial intelligence;WMT20 Chinese-English translation task;WMT14 English-German translation task;on-device NMT systems;mobile devices;AI;on-device neural machine translation;dynamic multibranch layers","","2","","25","IEEE","7 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) or a machine translation (MT) system can be used to generate the artificial hypotheses. When the reference transcriptions are not available, training can be done in an unsupervised way via a target output selection scheme.

For a machine to translate text in one natural language to target text in another language, it requires an understanding of the language, its grammar (syntax), its meaning (semantics) and the ability to use this knowledge for making inferences. Words have definite meaning(s) making them deterministic and finite. Words are not ambiguous in their meaning. Context dependency arises when a word is used with a group of words (bag-of-words) in a specific way that causes its meaning to be dependent on the group of words. In this paper, we present a hybrid, multi-pass Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger developed for Marathi sentences which builds feature vector for each word in a sentence by referring to the previous and next word preceding and succeeding the current word that is being tagged. The analysis of the Marathi input sentence is done first by tokenizing each word in the sentence and finding the stem for each token. Every token is analyzed for its POS tag, the tense, mood and aspect. This process is POS tagging. Ambiguities may arise in the process of tagging.","","978-1-5386-2051-9","10.1109/ICCICT.2018.8325898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325898","POS Ambiguity;Machine Translation;Marathi Grammar rules;Part-of-Speech (POS);Root/Stem of a Word;Stemming;Tagger;YASS","Grammar;Dictionaries;Computers;Tagging;Silicon;Mood;Feature extraction","language translation;natural language processing","Marathi input sentence;part-of-speech tagger;automatic translation;natural language;bag-of-words;machine translation;POS tagging;tagging process","","3","","","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Any Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) System needs large parallel corpora for exact performance. So, non-availability of corpora limits the success achievable in machine translation to and from those languages. In this study, we choose Sinhala to Tamil translation which gains importance since both of them are acknowledged as official languages of Sri Lanka and also resource-poor languages. Even though findings presented here is for Sinhala to Tamil translation, the concept of pre-processing is language neutral and can be transcended to any other language pair with different parameters. To overcome the translation challenges in traditional SMT, preprocessing techniques are used. Preprocessing described in the research is related to generating phrasal units, Parts of Speech (POS) integration and segmentation. At the end, automatic evaluation of the system is performed by using BLEU as evaluation metrics. We observed all preprocessing techniques outperform the baseline system. The best performance is reported with PMI based chunking for Sinh ala to Tamil translation. We could improve performance by 12% BLEU (3.56) using a small Sinhala to Tamil corpus with the help of proposed PMI based preprocessing. Notably, this increase is significantly higher compared to the increase shown by prior approaches for the same language pair.","","978-1-7281-1175-9","10.1109/IALP.2018.8629203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629203","Statistical Machine Translation;Preprocessing techniques;Sinhala to Tamil translation;Chunking;Segmentation;Natural language Processing","Linguistics;Syntactics;Tokenization;Standards;Semantics;Tagging;Data mining","language translation;natural language processing;statistical analysis","language neutral;language pair;preprocessing techniques;phrase-based statistical machine translation models;parts-of-speech information;parallel corpora;corpora limits;official languages;resource-poor languages;statistical machine translation system;PMI based chunking;Sinhala to Tamil translation","","1","","21","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we address: 1) the mismatch of adopted beam-widths between training and decoding; and 2) the mismatch of training criteria and MT evaluation metrics. Unlike previous work, we model the two problems in a single training paradigm simultaneously. We design a loss-augmented approach that explicitly considers the limited beam-width and evaluation metric in training, and present a simple but effective method to learn the model. By using beam search and BLEU-related losses, our approach improves a state-of-the-art syntactic MT system by +1.0 BLEU on Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation tasks.

The synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) was adopted to convert a Chinese structure to the corresponding TSL structure and then extract a translation memory which comprises the thematic relations between the grammar rules of both structures. In structural translation, the statistical MT (SMT) approach was used to align the thematic roles in the grammar rules and the translation memory provides the reference templates for TSL structure translation. Finally, the agreement information for TSL verbs was labeled for enriching the expressiveness of the translated TSL sequence. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the translation performance and the communication effectiveness for the deaf. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a baseline statistical MT system using the same small corpus, especially for the translation of long sentences.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2016234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165114","Sign language;small corpus;structural statistical machine translation (SSMT);thematic relation","Handicapped aids;Deafness;Natural languages;Surface-mount technology;Auditory system;Avatars;Information analysis;Data mining;Communication effectiveness;Employment","computational linguistics;context-free grammars;language translation;natural language processing;statistical analysis","structural statistical machine translation model;Taiwanese sign language;small corpus;thematic role template;translation memory;data sparseness problem;parallel bilingual corpus;linguistic information;Sinica Treebank;Chinese sentence analysis;synchronous context free grammar","","17","","35","IEEE","14 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the output probabilities for each class are concatenated to form a vector that represents the vocal signature of a speech recording. Finally, a similarity search is performed on the vocal signatures to determine the set of target actors that are the most similar to a speech recording of a source actor. In a subjective experiment conducted in the real-context of voice casting for video games, the multi-label system clearly outperforms standard speaker recognition systems.

Traditional attention mechanisms utilize prior input information to derive attention, which then conditions the output. However, we believe that knowledge of posterior output information may convey some advantage when modeling attention. A recent technique proposed for machine translation called the posterior attention model (PAM) demonstrates that posterior output information can be used in that way for machine translation. This paper explores the use of posterior information for attention modeling in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. We demonstrate that direct application of PAM to ASR is unsatisfactory, due to two deficiencies; Firstly, PAM adopts attention based weighted single-frame output prediction by assuming a single focused attention variable, whereas wider contextual information from acoustic frames is important for output prediction in ASR. Secondly, in addition to the well-known exposure bias problem, PAM introduces additional mismatches in attention training and inference calculations. We present extensive experiments combining a number of alternative approaches to solving these problems, leading to a high performance technique which we call extended PAM (EPAM). To counter the first deficiency, EPAM modifies the encoder to introduce additional context information for output prediction. The second deficiency is overcome in EPAM through a two part solution of a mismatch penalty term and an alternate learning strategy. The former applies a divergence-based loss to correct the mismatch bias distribution, while the latter employs a novel update strategy which relies on introducing iterative inference steps alongside each training step. In experiments with both WSJ-80hrs and Switchboard-300hrs datasets we found significant performance gains. For example, the full EPAM system model achieved a word error rate (WER) of 10.6% on the WSJ eval92 test set, compared to 11.6% for traditional prior-attention modeling. Meanwhile, on the Switchboard eval2000 test set, we achieved 16.3% WER compared to the traditional method WER of 17.3%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001636","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1002202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836219); Key Science and Technology Project of Anhui Province(grant numbers:18030901016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9114877","Speech recognition;posterior attention;divergence penalty;exposure bias;alternate learning strategy","Training;Decoding;Speech recognition;Acoustics;Optimization;Task analysis","inference mechanisms;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);speech recognition","EPAM system model;divergence-based loss;inference calculations;attention training;single-frame output prediction;ASR;automatic speech recognition;PAM;posterior attention model;machine translation;posterior output information;sequence-to-sequence mapping tasks;attention-based speech recognition","","2","","47","CCBY","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there exist two drawbacks in these approaches. First, they ignore the explicit word-level semantic interactions between source sentences, which have been shown effective in the embeddings of multilingual texts. Second, multiple source sentences are simultaneously encoded by an NMT model, which is unable to fully exploit the semantic information of each source sentence. In this paper, we explore multi-stage information interactions for multi-source NMT. Specifically, we first propose a multi-source NMT model that performs information interactions at the encoding stage. Its encoder contains multiple semantic interaction layers, each of which sequentially consists of (1) monolingual semantic interaction sub-layer, which is based on the self-attention mechanism and used to learn word-level monolingual contextual representations of source sentences, and (2) cross-lingual semantic interaction sub-layer, which leverages word alignments to perform fine-grained semantic transitions among hidden states of different source sentences. Furthermore, at the training stage, we introduce a mutual distillation based training framework, where single-source models and ours perform information interactions. Such framework can fully exploit the semantic information of each source sentence to enhance our model. Extensive experimental results on the WMT14 English-German-French dataset show our method exhibits significant improvements upon competitive baselines.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2021.3120592","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62036004,61672440); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China(grant numbers:2020J06001); Youth Innovation Fund of Xiamen(grant numbers:3502Z20206059); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576577","Information interactions;mutual distillation;natural language processing;neural machine translation","Semantics;Training;Machine translation;Encoding;Speech processing;Adaptation models;Transformers","information retrieval;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","multistage information interactions;multisource NMT model;performs information interactions;multiple semantic interaction layers;source sentence;cross-lingual semantic interaction sub-layer;single-source models;semantic information;multisource neural machine translation;explicit word-level semantic interactions","","1","","43","IEEE","15 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, prepositions are plays sound role in meaningful translation for any languages. While translating from English to Tamil, preposition in English sentences should be translated to postposition to have meaningful sentences. Thus the prepositional phase errors and orthographic errors are the major issue in machine translation. The main goal of this paper is to improve the translation quality. To achieve the goal, we use some semantic rule to correct the prepositional and orthographic errors in this English-Tamil translation.

These approaches sometimes make constraints rigid because they consider only a single factor instead of composite factors. Based on the considerations above, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework that integrates multiple features for translation model pruning. Experimental results show that our framework is effective by pruning 80% of the phrase-pairs and 70% of the hierarchical rules, while retaining the quality of the translation models when using the BLEU evaluation metric.

However, it is non-trivial to train such a model well due to the task complexity and data scarcity. The speech-and-text modality differences result in the E2E-ST model performance usually inferior to the corresponding machine translation (MT) model. Based on the above observation, existing methods often use sharing mechanisms to carry out implicit knowledge transfer by imposing various constraints. However, the final model often performs worse on the MT task than the MT model trained alone, which means that the knowledge transfer ability of this method is also limited. To deal with these problems, we propose the FCCL (Fine- and Coarse- Granularity Contrastive Learning) approach for E2E-ST, which makes explicit knowledge transfer through cross-modal multi-grained contrastive learning. A key ingredient of our approach is applying contrastive learning at both sentence- and frame-level to give the comprehensive guide for extracting speech representations containing rich semantic information. In addition, we adopt a simple whitening method to alleviate the representation degeneration in the MT model, which adversely affects contrast learning. Experiments on the MuST-C benchmark show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art E2E-ST baselines on all eight language pairs. Further analysis indicates that FCCL can free up its capacity from learning grammatical structure information and force more layers to learn semantic information.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2023.3244521","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171470,62276153); Central Plains Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10042965","Speech translation;contrastive learning;end-to-end","Task analysis;Semantics;Training;Data mining;Feature extraction;Data models;Training data","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","-text modality differences;contrast learning;corresponding machine translation model;cross-modal multigrained contrastive learning;data scarcity;E2E-ST model performance;end-to-end speech translation;makesexplicit knowledge;MT model;MT task;outimplicit knowledge;speech representations;state-of-the-art E2E-ST baselines;task complexity","","2","","70","IEEE","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Improved capabilities and reduced price of these platforms will have profound effect on their everyday usage and applications. In comparison to speech and natural language processing, which have established speech recognition and machine translation applications as indispensable in many contemporary CPSs, the vision community is still searching for an application that would be so necessary and desirable to make most of the consumers buy specific vision hardware just to run it. That would be the ultimate proof of the core value of the technology in the market. Thus, also vision problems come with a longstanding tradition and history of numerous solutions, it is still hard to point out a single application that would incorporate many specific vision tasks into one device, and which would be ubiquitously useful and affordable to all (e.g. like smartphone has done in the fields of communication and personal computing). However, with development of new miniaturization technologies and spatial AI it is reasonable to expect that there will be more possibilities for designing CPS with capabilities of visual understanding of outdoor, dynamic and uncontrolled environments. One step in such direction are embedded vision platforms that besides powerful computing capabilities also provide multimodal perception, and thus improve the algorithm performance. As an example, we will discuss stereo depth perception in the context of new spatial AI platforms like OAK-D lite, and point out some possibilities for its improvement and integration into future CPS.","2637-9511","978-1-6654-6828-2","10.1109/MECO55406.2022.9797078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797078","CPS;embedded vision;multimodal perception;spatial AI;depth from stereo;OAK-D lite","Performance evaluation;Visualization;Speech recognition;Market research;Machine translation;History;Artificial intelligence","computer vision;embedded systems;knowledge based systems;language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition;stereo image processing","embedded vision platforms;CPS;em-bedded vision platforms;Cyber-Physical Systems;everyday usage;natural language processing;speech recognition;machine translation applications;vision community;specific vision hardware;vision problems;single application;specific vision tasks;spatial AI platforms","","","","36","IEEE","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When these applications are deployed on web with increasing translation load web user experience degrades. The end user has to wait unusually longer to get his first visible response. Generic layer 3 load balancing techniques does not help to improve the response time as each job is assigned similar compute resources irrespective of job size. This paper presents an engineering approach to deploy MT system on cloud platform using Storm, a distributed computing framework. This scheme, by utilizing the inherent parallelism of a functional application, not only reduces the job completion time considerably but it, also as a web application, gives very good user experience, viz., the first visible response time within an acceptable time limit, and the subsequent responses well before the user finishes perusing the preceding response. Using Storm framework a translation job is split into multiple job partitions and is streamed into the storm cluster such that first job partitions of all jobs are processed before the second partitions, i.e., All nth partitions of all jobs are processed before (n+1)th partitions. Thus machine translation system is able to produce translation output as a continuous stream, sentence by sentence, as soon as each sentence gets translated. The system maintains flow rate of translated sentences stream high enough so that the next translated sentence is produced well before the end user finishes reading the previous sentence, thereby providing very good user experience. There is a class of natural language processing (NLP) applications, viz., machine translation systems, text to speech systems, speech recognition systems, etc., that are functional in nature, and this engineering approach would be equally applicable to them as well.","","978-1-4799-6719-3","10.1109/BDCloud.2014.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034793","NLP;Machine Translation;Storm Framework;Stream Processing;Interactive Response;Throughput;Performance","Storms;Time factors;Topology;Fasteners;Parallel processing;Speech recognition;Natural language processing","cloud computing;language translation;natural language processing;pattern clustering","transfer based machine translation system;MT system;user experience improvement;complex functional application;job completion time;job size;distributed computing framework;Web application;cloud platform;first visible response time;acceptable time limit;translation job;multiple job partitions;storm cluster;end user;natural language processing applications;NLP applications;text to speech systems;speech recognition systems;engineering approach","","1","","15","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We automatically extract a coherence chain for each source text to be translated. Based on the extracted source coherence chain, we adopt a maximum entropy classifier to predict the target coherence chain that defines a linear topic structure for the target document. We build two topic-based coherence models on the predicted target coherence chain: 1) a word level coherence model that helps the decoder select coherent word translations and 2) a phrase level coherence model that guides the decoder to select coherent phrase translations. We integrate the two models into a state-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation system. Experiments on large-scale training data show that our coherence models achieve substantial improvements over both the baseline and models that are built on either document topics or sentence topics obtained under the assumption of direct topic correspondence between the source and target side. Additionally, further evaluations on translation outputs suggest that target translations generated by our coherence models are more coherent and similar to reference translations than those generated by the baseline.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2015.2395254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050388","Text coherence;text analysis;coherence chain;topic modeling;statistical machine translation (SMT);natural language processing","Coherence;Predictive models;Hidden Markov models;Training data;Data models;NIST;Decoding","language translation;natural language processing;pattern classification;statistical analysis;text analysis","topic-based coherence modeling;statistical machine translation;text generation;text translation;document translation;sentence topics continuity;source text;extracted source coherence chain;maximum entropy classifier;linear topic structure;target coherence chain;word level coherence model;coherent word translations;phrase level coherence model;coherent phrase translations;phrase-based machine translation system;large-scale training data","","16","","33","IEEE","26 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At its basic level, MT performs simple substitution of atomic words in one natural language for words in another language. Around the world, numerous systems are available in the market for the assessment of the translation being done by the various translation systems. Even within India, a large number of such evaluation systems are available and a lot of research is still going on to develop a better evaluation system which can beat the results produced by Human Evaluators. Even the main challenge before Indian Researchers is that the evaluation systems which are giving unbeatable results for the translation of Foreign languages (such as German, French, Chinese, etc.) are not even giving considerable results for the translation of Indian Languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, etc.). So at par these evaluation systems cannot be applied as it is to evaluate Machine Translations of Indian Languages. Indian languages require a novel approach because of the relatively unrestricted order of words within a word group. In this paper, we are presenting an algorithm (by incorporating different modules of language models like synonym replacement, root word extraction and shallow parsing) which when applied upon the translation of English to Hindi text gives better evaluation results as compared to those algorithms which do not incorporate all these modules.

Learning a generative model from training domains enables us to translate each training sample under the special characteristics of other possible domains. We show that by training a predictor solely on the generated samples, the spurious correlations in training domains average out, and the invariant features corresponding to true correlations emerge.

Unknown word (UNK) symbols are used to represent out-of-vocabulary words because NMT typically operates with a fixed vocabulary size. These rare words can be effectively encoded as sequences of subword units by using algorithms, such as byte pair encoding (BPE), to tackle the UNK problem. However, for languages with highly inflected and morphological variations, such as Arabic, the aforementioned method has its own limitations that make it not effective enough for translation quality. To alleviate the UNK problem and address the inconvenient behavior of BPE when translating the Arabic language, we propose to utilize a romanization system that converts Arabic scripts to subword units. We investigate the effect of our approach on NMT performance under various segmentation scenarios and compare the results with systems trained on original Arabic form. In addition, we integrate Romanized Arabic as an input factor for Arabic-sourced NMT compared with well-known factors, namely, lemma, part-of-speech tags, and morph features. Extensive experiments on Arabic-Chinese translation demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively tackle the UNK problem and significantly improve the translation quality for Arabic-sourced translation. Additional experiments in this study focus on developing the NMT system on Chinese-Arabic translation. Before implementing our experiments, we first propose standard criteria for the data filtering of a parallel corpus, which helps in filtering out its noise.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941161","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876190,61802120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835016","Arabic morphology;Arabic romanization;BPE;data filtering;linguistic feature;morphological segmentation;neural machine translation","Filtering;Vocabulary;Linguistics;Standards;Training;Economics","language translation;natural language processing;text analysis;vocabulary;word processing","Arabic-Chinese neural machine translation;Romanized Arabic;subword unit;Arabic-sourced translation;rich languages;complex languages;rare words;unknown word symbols;out-of-vocabulary words;fixed vocabulary size;byte pair encoding;UNK problem;highly inflected variations;morphological variations;translation quality;Arabic language;romanization system;Arabic scripts;NMT performance;original Arabic form;Arabic-sourced NMT;Arabic-Chinese translation;NMT system;Chinese-Arabic translation;BPE","","10","","46","CCBY","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose a gradient-based NAS algorithm for NMT, which automatically discovers architectures with better performances. Compared with previous NAS work, we jointly search the network operations (e.g., LSTM, CNN, self-attention etc) as well as dropout rates to ensure better results. We show that with reasonable resources it is possible to discover novel neural network architectures for NMT, which achieve consistently better performances than Transformer [1], the state-of-the-art NMT model, across different tasks. On WMT'14 English-to-German translation, IWSLT'14 German-to-English translation and WMT'18 Finnish-to-English translation tasks, our discovered architectures could obtain 30.1, 36.1 and 26.4 BLEU scores, which are great improvement over Transformer baselines.

More than 2427 monosyllabic speech units and 2234 word speech units of Hakka and several silences with various durations have been recorded as basic units for speech synthesis. We focus on adding breaks to speeches, with emphasis on predicting the types of break. There are three kinds of breaks: major break, minor break and no-break between words. We train a break model and predict break based on the data mining approaches - Bayesian network (BN) and CART classifier. The best precision rate for testing achieves 80.17% based on the CART. Fourteen students familiar with Hakka joined to evaluate the prosody quality of synthesized speeches. The results with 10 scale achieves 7.54 score in average.

Neural Machine Translation(NMT) also outperforms Statistical Machine Translation(SMT) which has complex features and rules. However, NMT requires a large corpus and a long calculation time. In order to suppress calculation cost, recent researches replaced low frequency words with symbols. However, the symbols make sentences ambiguous and deteriorates translation accuracy. To solve this problem, sub-word units such as Byte Pair Encoding(BPE) and Wordpiece Model(WPM) creating vocabularies in a prespecified vocabulary size has been proposed. Nevertheless, these tokenize methods break words and treat them as symbols. Words as symbols are compatible with neural networks and NMT performance has increased. This result shows that linguistic correctness is not necessarily important in NMT. If that is the case, we wonder to what extent linguistic correctness contributes to NMT accuracy. In this research, we experiment to incorporate linguistic information into sub-word units. Experimentally, we demonstrate that morpheme as linguistic information is a helpful factor for sub-word units.","","978-1-5386-3001-3","10.1109/ICAICTA.2017.8090975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090975","","Pragmatics;Vocabulary;Decoding;Computer architecture;Mathematical model;Telescopes","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);linguistics;natural language processing;neural nets;speech recognition;statistical analysis;text analysis","calculation cost;low frequency words;symbols;translation accuracy;sub-word units;prespecified vocabulary size;NMT performance;NMT accuracy;linguistic information;natural language processing;Byte Pair Encoding;BPE;Wordpiece Model;WPM;linguistic correctness;Deep Neural Networks;DNN;Neural Machine Translation;NMT;Statistical Machine Translation;SMT","","1","","16","IEEE","2 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents English to Arabic approach for translating well-structured English sentences into well-structured Arabic sentences, using a grammar-based and example-translation techniques to handle the problems of ordering and agreement. This technique combines rule-based MT (RBMT) and example-based MT (EBMT) which is called hybrid-based MT (HERBMT). The proposed methodology is flexible and scalable. The main advantages of HERBMT are that it combines the advantages of RBMT and EBMT, and it can be applied to other languages with minor modifications. EBMT extracts an example of target language sentences that are analogous to input source language sentences. The extraction of appropriate translated sentences is preceded by an analysis stage for the decomposition of input sentences into appropriate fragments. RBMT is used when examples of the source language to be translated into the target language are not found in the machine database. The OAK Parser is used to analyze the input English text to get the part of speech (POS) for each word in the text as a pre-translation process. A major design goal of this system is that it will be used as a stand-alone tool, and can be integrated with a general machine translation system for English sentences. The evaluation is carried out on 250 independent test suites, and the analysis indicates that HERBMT achieved good performance with an average of 97.2% precision.","","978-1-4799-0136-4","10.1109/ICT4M.2013.6518910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6518910","MT;Agreement;Word reorder;Rule-Based;Example-based;Hybrid-based;OAK Parser","Grammar;Databases;Syntactics;Google;Educational institutions;Data mining;Pragmatics","knowledge based systems;language translation;natural language processing","grammar-based technique;example-based technique;machine translation;English-to-Arabic translation;language translation;English sentence;Arabic sentence;example-translation technique;rule-based MT;example-based MT;RBMT;EBMT;hybrid-based MT;HERBMT;language sentence;part-of-speech;OAK Parser;POS","","","","12","IEEE","23 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective is to exploit the phonotactic properties of language families, where small amounts of accurately transcribed data across languages can be pooled together to train TTS systems. These systems can then be adapted to new languages belonging to the same family in extremely low-resource scenarios. TTS systems are trained separately for Indo-Aryan and Dravidian language families, and their performance is compared to that of a combined Indo-Aryan+Dravidian voice. We also investigate the amount of training data required for a language in a multilingual setting. Same-family and cross-family synthesis and adaptation to unseen languages are analysed.

We advance the semantic correlation between textual and visual modalities in MNMT by incorporating WRA as a bridge. This proposal has been implemented on two mainstream architectures of neural machine translation (NMT): the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the transformer. Experiments on two public benchmarks, English–German and English–French translation tasks using the Multi30k dataset and English–Japanese translation tasks using the Flickr30kEnt-JP dataset prove that our model has a significant improvement with respect to the competitive baselines across different evaluation metrics and outperforms most of the existing MNMT models. For example, 1.0 BLEU scores are improved for the English–German task and 1.1 BLEU scores are improved for the English–French task on the Multi30k test2016 set; and 0.7 BLEU scores are improved for the English–Japanese task on the Flickr30kEnt-JP test set.

It is straightforward to fine-tune them on natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, however, effectively and efficiently incorporating them into natural language generation tasks such as neural machine translation remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we integrate two pre-trained BERT models from the source and target language domains into a sequence-to-sequence model by introducing light-weight adapter modules. The adapters are inserted between BERT layers and tuned on downstream tasks, while the parameters of BERT models are fixed during fine-tuning. As pre-trained language models are usually very deep, inserting adapters into all layers will result in a considerable scale of new parameters. To deal with this problem, we introduce latent variables to decide whether using adapters or not in each layer, which are learned during fine-tuning. In this way, the model is able to automatically determine which adapters to use, therefore hugely promoting the parameter efficiency and decoding speed. We evaluate the proposed framework on various neural machine translation tasks. Equipped with parallel sequence decoding, our model consistently outperforms autoregressive baselines while reducing the inference latency by half. With automatic adapter selection, the proposed model further achieves 20% speedup while still outperforming autoregressive baselines. When applied to autoregressive decoding, the proposed model can also achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art baseline models.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2021.3076863","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20A20229); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085J31); Alibaba Group through Alibaba Research Intern Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420282","Pre-trained language model;adapter;neural machine translation","Adaptation models;Bit error rate;Task analysis;Decoding;Machine translation;Natural languages;Training","decoding;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","sequence-to-sequence model;light-weight adapter modules;BERT;downstream tasks;parameter efficiency;neural machine translation tasks;parallel sequence decoding;automatic adapter selection;adaptive adapters;pre-trained language models;natural language understanding tasks;natural language generation tasks","","2","","62","IEEE","30 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As times goes on, It is widely recognized that transfer learning methods are effective for low-resource language problems. However, existing transfer learning methods are typically based on the parent-child architecture, which does not adequately take advantages of helpful languages. In this paper, inspired by human transitive inference and learning ability, we handle this issue by proposing a new hierarchical transfer learning architecture for low-resource languages. In the architecture, the NMT model is trained in the unrelated high-resource language pair, the similar intermediate language pair and the low-resource language pair in turn. Correspondingly, the parameters are transferred and fine-tuned layer by layer for initialization. In this way, our hierarchical transfer learning architecture simultaneously combines the data volume advantages of high-resource languages and the syntactic similarity advantages of cognate languages. Specially, we utilize Byte Pair Encoding(BPE) and character-level embedding for data pre-processing, which effectively solve the problem of out of vocabulary(OOV). Experimental results on Uygur-Chinese and Turkish-English translation demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed architecture over the NMT model with parent-child architecture.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936002","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1703133); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2017-XBQNXZ-A-005); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2017472); Major Science and Technology Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2016A03007-3); Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Level Talent Introduction Project(grant numbers:Y839031201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805098","Hierarchical transfer learning;low-resource problem;neural machine translation","Computer architecture;Learning systems;Training;Computational modeling;Syntactics;Solid modeling;Decoding","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;vocabulary","OOV;out of vocabulary problem;existing transfer learning methods;low-resource language problems;low-resource neural machine translation;parent-child architecture;cognate languages;high-resource languages;low-resource language pair;similar intermediate language pair;high-resource language pair;NMT model;low-resource languages;hierarchical transfer learning architecture;learning ability;human transitive inference;helpful languages","","9","","56","CCBY","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is a limitation when signals from some modalities are unavailable or severely degraded. To address this limitation, we aim to improve the testing performance of uni-modal systems using multiple modalities during training only. The proposed multi-modal training framework uses cross-modal translation and correlation-based latent space alignment to improve the representations of a worse performing (or weaker) modality. The translation from the weaker to the better performing (or stronger) modality generates a multi-modal intermediate encoding that is representative of both modalities. This encoding is then correlated with the stronger modality representation in a shared latent space.

Evidence from human learning suggests that additional modalities can provide disambiguating signals crucial for many language tasks. In this article, we describe the How2 dataset , a large, open-domain collection of videos with transcriptions and their translations. We then show how this single dataset can be used to develop systems for a variety of language tasks and present a number of models meant as starting points. Across tasks, we find that building multimodal architectures that perform better than their unimodal counterpart remains a challenge.

Previous studies mainly focus on training stage optimization and improve positive knowledge transfer among languages with different levels of parameter sharing, but ignore the multilingual knowledge transfer during inference although the translation in one language may help the generation of other languages. This work enhances knowledge sharing among multiple target languages in the inference phase. To achieve this, we propose a synchronous inference method that can simultaneously generate translations in multiple languages. During generation, the model that predicts the next word of each language not only based on source sentence and previously predicted segments, but also based on predicted words of other target languages. To maximize the inference stage knowledge sharing, we design a cross-lingual attention module which allows the model to dynamically selects the most relevant information from multiple target languages. The synchronous inference model requires multi-way parallel training data which is scarce. We therefore propose to adopt multi-task learning to incorporate large-scale bilingual data.

At the inference stage, however, the decoder predicts the next token solely based on history generated from scratch. Both using ground truth history and predicting ground truth words potentially lead to exposure bias. On the one hand, to alleviate the issue of exposure bias caused by using ground truth history, we propose contextual augmentation by allowing substitution, insertion, and deletion of words. The contextual augmentation applies to target sequence to generate non-ground truth and natural history when predicting next words. On the other hand, to alleviate the exposure bias caused by predicting ground truth words, we further apply self distillation to guide the model to carry out optimization according to smoothed prediction distribution, i.e, enable the model to predict not only ground truth words, but also other potentially correct and reasonable words. Experimental results on WMT14 English $\leftrightarrow$ German and IWSLT14 German $\rightarrow$ English translation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over Transformer on standard benchmarks. Detailed experimental analyses further reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving translation quality.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2023.3277245","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128685","Contextual augmentation;exposure bias;neural machine translation;self distillation","History;Predictive models;Training;Decoding;Task analysis;Machine translation;Perturbation methods","inference mechanisms;language translation;natural language processing","alleviating exposure bias;contextual augmentation;ground truth history;ground truth word;neural machine translation;nonground truth;potentially correct words;predicting ground truth words;reasonable words;seq2seq;sequence-to-sequence models;smoothed prediction distribution","","","","45","IEEE","17 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding techinque is inverstigated for the selection of an appropriate alignment reference.

Usually, the teacher can guide the student to be better by distilling the soft label or data knowledge from the teacher itself. However, the data diversity and teacher knowledge are limited with only one teacher model. Though a natural solution is to adopt multiple randomized teacher models, one big shortcoming is that the model parameters and training costs are largely increased with the number of teacher models. In this work, we explore to mimic multiple teacher distillation from the sub-network space and permuted variants of one single teacher model. Specifically, we train a teacher by multiple sub-network extraction paradigms: sub-layer reordering, layer-drop, and dropout variants. In doing so, one teacher model can provide multiple outputs variants and causes neither additional parameters nor much extra training cost.

Based on our experiments, the beginning part of a European Portuguese (EP) sentence enables better identification of the sentence's boundaries. In addition, a window frame of spectrogram constructed by the previous ending of 100 milliseconds (ms) and the subsequent beginning of 300 ms presents the best performance in the automatic sentence segmentation.

The task is to translate TED talks (www.ted.com). This task presents two unique challenges: Firstly, the underlying topic switches sharply from talk to talk, and each one contains only tens to hundreds of utterances. The translation system therefore needs to adapt to the current topic quickly and dynamically. Secondly, unlike other machine translation benchmark tasks, only a very small relevant parallel corpus (transcripts of TED talks) is available. Therefore, it is necessary to perform accurate translation model estimation with limited data. In this paper, we present our recent progress and two new methods on the IWSLT TED talk translation task from Chinese into English. In particular, to address the first problem, we use unsupervised topic modeling to select additional topic-dependent parallel data from a globally irrelevant corpus. These additional data slices can then be used to build an unsupervised topic-adapted machine translation system. For the second problem, we develop a discriminative training method to estimate the translation models more accurately. Our experimental evaluation results show that both methods improve the translation quality over a state-of-the-art baseline.","2379-190X","978-1-4673-0046-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289029","spoken language translation;topic adaptation;discriminative training;IWSLT","Adaptation models;Training;Hidden Markov models;Data models;Estimation;Benchmark testing;Helium","language translation;natural language processing;speech processing","IWSLT benchmark task;spoken language translation system;International Workshop on Spoken Language Processing;machine translation benchmark tasks;IWSLT TED talk translation task;unsupervised topic modeling;topic-dependent parallel data;data slices;unsupervised topic-adapted machine translation system;discriminative training method","","","","18","IEEE","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also identifying the name entities and cognates present in the sentence pairs has proved to be advantageous while setting up the alignments.

However, in low-resource neural machine translation, a stronger teacher model is not available. To counteract this, We therefore propose a novel Teacher-free Knowledge Distillation framework for low-resource neural machine translation, where the model learns from manually designed regularization distribution as a virtual teacher model. The prior distribution of artificial design can not only obtain the similarity information between words, but also provide effective regularity for model training.

Unfortunately, those constraints may contain mistakes in real-world situations and incorrect constraints will undermine lexically constrained decoding. In this article, we propose a novel framework that is capable of improving the translation quality even if the constraints are noisy. The key to our framework is to treat the lexical constraints as external memories. More concretely, it encodes the constraints by a memory encoder and then leverages the memories by a memory integrator. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can not only deliver substantial BLEU gains in handling noisy constraints, but also achieve speedup in decoding. These results motivate us to apply our models to a new scenario where the constraints are generated without the help of users. Experiments show that our models can indeed improve the translation quality with the automatically generated constraints.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2020.2999724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9108255","Neural machine translation;lexical constraints","Memory management;Noise measurement;Decoding;Encoding;Standards;Speech processing","language translation;natural language processing;neural nets","translation quality;external memories;memory encoder;memory integrator;neural machine translation;noisy lexical constraints;lexical constrained decoding;BLEU","","","","54","IEEE","4 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We discover the Common Difference Property that one orthogonal transformation can connect not only the input vectors of two languages but also the output vectors. Therefore, we can learn just one transformation to induce two different dictionaries from the input and output vectors, respectively. Between these two quite different dictionaries, a more accurate lexicon with less noise can be induced by taking the intersection of them in UBLI procedure.

In this paper, we conjecture that the use of fixed annotations is the bottleneck in improving the performance ofconventional attention-based NMT. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose a novel model for attention-based NMT, which is intended to update the source annotations recursively when generating the target word at each time step.

In contrast, our new approach propagates a semantic frame based objective function back into much earlier stages of the pipeline, during the actual learning of the translation model, biasing learning toward semantically more accurate alignments. This approach is motivated by the fact that ITG alignments have empirically been shown to fully cover crosslingual semantic frame alternations, even though they rule out an overwhelming majority of the space of possible alignments. We show that directly driving ITG induction with a crosslingual semantic based objective function not only helps to further sharpen the ITG constraints, but still avoids excising relevant portions of the search space, and leads to better performance than either conventional ITG or GIZA++ based approaches.","2472-7695","978-1-5090-3516-8","10.1109/ICSDA.2016.7919000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7919000","","Decision support systems;Conferences;Standardization;Speech;Databases","language translation;pipeline processing","spoken language translation systems;crosslingual semantic frame based objective function;inversion transduction grammar induction;loglinear mixture weights;statistical machine translation training;ITG alignments;ITG constraints;search space","","","","33","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is one of the major challenges in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), driving an intense research activity in these areas. Speech translation is useful to assist person-to-person communication in limited domains like tourism and traveling and to translate foreign parliamentary speeches and broadcast news. Speech translation is based on a suitable combination of two independent technologies, namely ASR and MT of written language. Thus, the important question is how to pass on the ASR ambiguities to the MT process. A unifying framework for this ASR-MT interface is provided by applying the Bayes decision rule to the speech translation tasks as whole rather than to each task individually. Depending on the MT approaches used, such as finite-state transducers or phrase-based modeling, various types of ASR-MT interfaces have been studied, ranging from N-best lists through word lattices to confusion networks. We have discussed experimental results on various tasks, ranging from limited to unrestricted domains. Despite the significant advances and the large number of experimental studies, it is still an open question what type of interface provides a suitable compromise between translation accuracy and computational cost.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2008.917989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4490204","","Natural languages;Automatic speech recognition;Speech processing;Robustness;Surveillance;Europe;Broadcasting;Image converters;Decision theory","Bayes methods;decision theory;language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition","spoken language translation;automatic speech recognition;machine translation;person-to-person communication;Bayes decision rule;finite-state transducer;phrase-based modeling;statistical approach;foreign parliamentary speech;word lattice;confusion network","","15","2","30","IEEE","18 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

No component of the model can be (re-)used without the others, making it impossible to share parts, e.g. a high resourced decoder, across tasks. We describe LegoNN, a procedure for building encoder-decoder architectures in a way so that its parts can be applied to other tasks without the need for any fine-tuning. To achieve this reusability, the interface between encoder and decoder modules is grounded to a sequence of marginal distributions over a pre-defined discrete vocabulary. We present two approaches for ingesting these marginals; one is differentiable, allowing the flow of gradients across the entire network, and the other is gradient-isolating. To enable the portability of decoder modules between MT tasks for different source languages and across other tasks like ASR, we introduce a modality agnostic encoder which consists of a length control mechanism to dynamically adapt encoders' output lengths in order to match the expected input length range of pre-trained decoders. We present several experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of LegoNN models: a trained language generation LegoNN decoder module from German-English (De-En) MT task can be reused without any fine-tuning for the Europarl English ASR and the Romanian-English (Ro-En) MT tasks, matching or beating the performance of baseline. After fine-tuning, LegoNN models improve the Ro-En MT task by 1.5 BLEU points and achieve 12.5% relative WER reduction on the Europarl ASR task. To show how the approach generalizes, we compose a LegoNN ASR model from three modules – each has been learned within different end-to-end trained models on three different datasets – achieving an overall WER reduction of 19.5%.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2023.3296019","FAIR, Meta Platforms Inc.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184317","End-to-end;encoder-decoder models;modularity;speech recognition;machine translation","Task analysis;Decoding;Vocabulary;Predictive models;Training;Artificial intelligence;Machine translation","decoding;encoding;language translation;natural language processing;neural nets;speech recognition","atomic unit;automatic speech recognition;De-En;decoder modules;encoder-decoder architectures;end-to-end trained models;Europarl ASR task;Europarl English ASR;German-English;gradient-isolating;high resourced decoder;LegoNN ASR model;length control mechanism;machine translation;marginal distributions;modality agnostic encoder;modular encoder-decoder models;MT task;pre-defined discrete vocabulary;pre-trained decoders;Romanian-English MT tasks;source languages;state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models","","","","73","IEEE","17 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy for neural machine translation. Unlike existing data augmentation methods that simply modify words with the same probability across different sentences, we introduce a sentence-specific probability approach for word selection based on the syntactic roles of words in the sentence. Our motivation is to consider a linguistics-motivated method to obtain more ingenious language generation rather than relying on computation-motivated approaches only. We argue that high-quality aligned bilingual data is crucial for NMT, and only computation-motivated data augmentation is insufficient to provide good enough extra enhancement data. Our approach leverages dependency parse trees of input sentences to determine the selection probability of each word in the sentence using three different functions to calculate probabilities for words with different depths. Besides, our method also revises the probability for words considering the sentence length. We evaluate our methods on multiple translation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data augmentation method does effectively boost existing sentence-independent methods for significant improvement of performance on translation tasks. Furthermore, an ablation study shows that our method does select fewer essential words and preserves the syntactic structure.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2023.3301214","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0304100); Key Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836222,61733011); Huawei-SJTU long term AI project, Cutting-edge Machine Reading Comprehension and Language Model; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10202198","Natural language processing;neural machine translation;data augmentation;dependency parsing","Data augmentation;Transformers;Training;Task analysis;Data models;Syntactics;Linguistics","computational linguistics;data augmentation;grammars;language translation;natural language processing;probability;trees (mathematics)","additional bilingual data;computation-motivated approaches;data augmentation method;different sentences;existing sentence-independent methods;extra enhancement data;fewer essential words;high-quality aligned bilingual data;input sentences;linguistics-motivated method;multiple translation tasks;neural machine translation;NMT;novel data augmentation strategy;selection probability;sentence length;sentence-specific probability approach;syntax-aware data augmentation;word selection","","","","58","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A method is proposed for manually translating a portion of the training set for training an automatic machine translation (MT) system to be used for translating the remaining data. As the source language is annotated in terms of concept tags, a solution is presented for automatically transferring these tags to the translated corpus.

The automatic evaluation metrics are expected to be easily computable and a reflection of human evaluation. Traditional string-based metrics such as BLEU, ChrF++ scores, are widely used to evaluate MT systems, but fail to account for synonyms that appear in the state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) systems, owing to their inability to evaluate paraphrases. While similarity-based metrics such as Yisi, BERTScore address this issue, these metrics need to be modified to better evaluate morphologically rich Indian languages such as, Tamil and Hindi. The current work proposes a novel and individual sentence-BERT based similarity (SBSim) metric, that makes use of a paraphrase-BERT model and sentence-level embedding to evaluate NMT outputs. The effectiveness of the BLEU, ChrF++, Yisi, BERTScore, and the proposed SBSim are evaluated on English-to-Tamil and English-to-Hindi NMT outputs. The sentence-level metric correlation of the proposed SBSim metric with respect to human scores is observed to outperform the existing metrics with a correlation of 0.9123 and 0.9052 for English-to-Tamil and English-to-Hindi NMT systems, respectively. Further, the average metric correlation of the SBSim metric is also observed to be the highest with a value of 0.9801 and 0.9836 for these NMT systems, respectively. The proposed metric is also evaluated on WMT2020 dataset and reports the highest correlation of 0.7129 with the human scores.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3161160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739828","Automatic evaluation;human correlation;individual metric;paraphrase-BERT;sentence-BERT","Measurement;Speech processing;Correlation;Computational modeling;Surface morphology;Machine translation;Linguistics","language translation;natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","English-to-Hindi NMT systems;SBSim metric;sentence-BERT similarity-based evaluation metric;Indian language neural machine translation systems;automatic evaluation metrics;human evaluation scores;paraphrase-BERT model;sentence-level metric correlation;BLEU;BERTScore;WMT2020 dataset;English-to-Tamil NMT systems;sentence-level embedding;Yisi scores;ChrF++ scores","","8","","27","IEEE","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We believe that this formulation combines the regularizing effect of dropout with the smoothing effects of the convolution operation. In addition to convolutional dropout, this paper also proposes using random word-piece segmentations as a data augmentation scheme during training, inspired by results in neural machine translation.

In today's oral world, a gesture-based language is not particularly popular with the general masses. However, sign language itself is a fully developed language with multiple regional dialects across the globe. Therefore, to aid with a smoother communication between the speaking and non-speaking world, technical developments can be introduced. A considerable amount of work has been done in this direction. The basic need of the hour is for an application that can function in real-time and can facilitate real-time conversations between a person who can sign in sign language and one that cannot. This paper proposes an application that works on this problem statement. In order to construct such an application designed to respond in real-time and aid a live conversation between a speaking and nonspeaking individual, it is necessary to allow for live video inputs to be made to the app which would then be translated to speech. This paper proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) alongside the use of Text-to-Speech translator. By use of the CNN algorithm, the gestures can be identified by the proposed application and converted to text, which can then be converted into speech.","","978-1-7281-6851-7","10.1109/ICCCNT49239.2020.9225422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9225422","Indian Sign Language;real-time;gesture recognition;neural networks;machine learning;text-to-speech algorithms","Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Training;Real-time systems;Speech recognition;Libraries;Text recognition","convolutional neural nets;gesture recognition;handicapped aids;language translation;natural language processing;sign language recognition;speech processing","oral world;gesture-based language;sign language;fully developed language;nonspeaking world;text-to-speech translator;speech translation;convolutional neural networks;CNN","","3","","25","IEEE","15 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It helps reduce the `hearing' people's difficulties in connecting with the hearing-impaired community. Thus, it can aid in the inclusion of hard-hearing in the rest of society. We have developed a system to translate a simple Marathi language sentence to the equivalent Indian Sign Language representation. We have studied the morpho-syntactic characteristics of both languages, and contrastive analysis is discussed here. This study gave us a cue to attempt translation at phrase level from the source language side. We have formulated the rules to extract necessary grammatical knowledge and to utilize it for translation. The detailed approach, experimentation, and results are also addressed in this research work.

Given the barriers faced by speech-impaired individuals, this system introduced a tool that bridges communication gaps and supports better interactions. This work focuses on introducing a tool that should bridge the communication gap among speech impaired community. The work involves the development of a system that enables two-way conversation between people with speech disorders and noisy people. LSTM networks were studied and implemented for the classification of gesture data because of their ability to learn long-term dependencies. In real-time, the sign language gestures of speech-impaired individuals are fed to the system by the device's computer vision capabilities. These gestures are recognized using deep neural networks, while hand recognition is cracked with edge detection algorithms that interpret in both text and speech formats. The model is trained with the dataset that is collected using holistic key points from the video of the person which detects the pose, face and hand landmarks. These will convert speech to text and finally displays the relevant hand gestures.

These approaches, while indeed accomplishing this task, induce a certain degree of inflexibility in their implementation. Recent explorations in this domain have attempted to utilize Neural Machine Translation techniques to convert natural language to SPARQL queries, with a focus on information retrieval from pre-established Knowledge Graphs. We explore in detail, the variety of approaches followed for SPARQL machine translation, with a keen focus on insertion of extracted knowledge into the graphs.As part of our research, we curated a dataset- Scientists-100, extracted from Dbpedia, for the task of translation of natural language to SPARQL insertion statements. We also propose two models - an Attention RNN and a Transformer for the same. These models achieve an accuracy of 99.27% and a 98.61% respectively on the dataset. In addition to this, we present a metric for examining the syntactic accuracy of the generated SPARQL statements.

In other word, there may be many translations of a source text in which the most convenient one should be selected. The Holy Koran is one of the well-known books in the world which has been descended in Arabic and most of peoples would like to understand more about this book. As a result, there are more than 100 translations of Koran from Arabic to English. In this paper a system has been designed to evaluate different English translations of Koran using tools and concepts such as pos-tagging, natural language processing, computational linguistic and machine learning. To do such an evaluation, each verb process type in translated text should be compared with it's of Koran text. The system uses Halliday Grammar, which is a useful theory for analyzing a formal text, to do this. It has been assumed that each verb in the text of Koran has been tagged manually. At the other hand, to detect each verb process type in translated English texts, a tagger is used to detect and tag each verb based on Halliday grammar. The best translation is one in which the number of similar verb process type in the source and translated text is maximum. This evaluation's been performed on 5 English translations of Holy Koran (Qaraei, Pickthal, Arberry, Progressive Muslims, Yusuf Ali) in scope of Bashir and Nadhir Ayahs of Baqarah and Alelmran Surahs and the results show that Yusuf Ali translation is the best. In this paper, it has been tried to create not only a new way to analyze the quality of translating a text but also take a step to discover concepts and meanings of the Koran. Although it is seemed that some of Koran words are so meaningful that it is nearly impossible to put them in one class of verb process type.","","978-1-4244-1751-3","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530013","","Natural language processing;Computational linguistics;Books;Machine learning;Speech analysis;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Java;Performance evaluation;Statistics;Natural languages","language translation;natural language processing","English translations;holy Koran;verb process type;Arabic;computational linguistic;machine learning;Halliday Grammar","","2","","11","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed network extracts structural features through a bidirectional LSTM-based sub-network, and intricate contextual relations among words of a sentence are identified through an elaborate weighted context extraction procedure. These features are then combinedly utilized to generate the final Parts-of-Speech prediction. Training the model requires only an annotated dataset vanishing the need for any hand-crafted features.

A multimodal word discovery system accepts, as input, a database of spoken descriptions of images (or a set of corresponding phone transcriptions) and learns a mapping from waveform segments (or phone strings) to their associated image concepts. In this article, four multimodal word discovery systems are demonstrated: three models based on statistical machine translation (SMT) and one based on neural machine translation (NMT). The systems are trained with phonetic transcriptions, MFCC and multilingual bottleneck features (MBN). On the phone-level, the SMT outperforms the NMT model, achieving a 61.6% F1 score in the phone-level word discovery task on Flickr30k.

The key component is a new procedure to directly optimize the global scoring function used by a statistical machine translation (SMT) decoder. This training procedure treats the decoder as a black-box, and thus can be used to optimize any decoding scheme. The novel algorithm is evaluated using different feature types: 1) commonly used probabilistic features, such as translation, language, or distortion model probabilities, and 2) binary features. In particular, encouraging results on a standard Arabic–English translation task are presented for a translation system that uses only binary feature functions. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel training algorithm, a detailed comparison with the widely used minimum-error-rate (MER) training algorithm is presented using the same decoder and feature set. The online algorithm is simplified by introducing so-called “seed” block sequences which enable the training to be carried out without a gold standard block translation. While the online training algorithm is extremely fast, it also improves translation scores over the MER algorithm in some experiments.

Since large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora are usually costly to collect, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. Inspired by the law of total probability, which connects the probability of a given target-side monolingual sentence to the conditional probability of translating from a source sentence to the target one, we propose to explicitly exploit this connection and help the training procedure of NMT models using monolingual data. The key technical challenge of this approach is that there are exponentially many source sentences for a target monolingual sentence while computing the sum of the conditional probability given each possible source sentence. We address this challenge by leveraging the reverse translation model (target-to-source translation model) to sample several mostly likely source-side sentences and avoid enumerating all possible candidate source sentences. Then we propose two different methods to leverage the law of total probability, including marginal distribution regularization and likelihood maximization of monolingual corpora. Experiment results on English-French and German-English tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve significant improvement over several strong baselines.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2019.2921423","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB1000904); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61727809,U1605251); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732422","Neural machine translation;semi-supervised learning;natural language processing","Training;Data models;Decoding;Neural networks;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Task analysis","language translation;natural language processing;neural nets;probability","marginal distribution regularization;likelihood maximization;monolingual corpora;semisupervised neural machine translation;marginal distribution estimation;high-quality parallel corpora;total probability;conditional probability;NMT models;monolingual data;target monolingual sentence;reverse translation model;target-to-source translation model;source-side sentences;source sentences;target-side monolingual sentence;parallel bilingual corpora;English-French tasks;German-English tasks","","7","","51","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel method to connect a re-alignment model with a translation model in an integrated framework. We conduct bilingual chart parsing based on syntax-augmented synchronous context-free grammar. A Viterbi derivation tree is generated for each sentence pair with multiple features employed in a log-linear model. A new word alignment is created under the structural constraint from the Viterbi tree. Extensive experiments are conducted in a Farsi-to-English translation task in conversational speech domain and also a German-to-English translation task in text domain.

In this work, several techniques are explored to directly incorporate the NNLM into the decoder of speech recognition. A novel training algorithm based on variance regularization is proposed to approximate the softmax-normalizing factor as a constant for fast evaluation. Also, the evaluation of NNLM is further speeded up via our advanced storage. Moreover, a simple cache-based strategy is explored to avoid redundant computations during the decoding process. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time to directly incorporate NNLM into decoding. We evaluate our proposed methods on an English-Switchboard phone-call speech-to-text task.

However, previous methods have no good mechanism to control this attention weight distribution. In this paper, we propose a sparse attention model in which a sparsity regularization term is designed to augment the objective function. We explore two kinds of regularizations: $L_{\infty }$-norm regularization and minimum entropy regularization, both of which aim to sharpen the attention weight distribution.

To this end, previous works choose either to alter the architecture of NMT encoder to incorporate syntactic information into the translation model, or to generalize the embedding layer of the encoder to encode additional linguistic features. The former approach mainly focuses on injecting the syntactic structure of the source sentence into the encoding process, leading to a complicated model that lacks the flexibility to incorporate other types of knowledge. The latter extends word embeddings by considering additional linguistic knowledge as features to enrich the word representation. It thus does not explicitly balance the contribution from word embeddings and the contribution from additional linguistic knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a knowledge-aware NMT approach that models additional linguistic features in parallel to the word feature. The core idea is that we propose modeling a series of linguistic features at the word level (knowledge block) using a recurrent neural network (RNN). And in sentence level, those word-corresponding feature blocks are further encoded using a RNN encoder. In decoding, we propose a knowledge gate and an attention gate to dynamically control the proportions of information contributing to the generation of target words from different sources. Extensive experiments show that our approach is capable of better accounting for importance of additional linguistic, and we observe significant improvements from 1.0 to 2.3 BLEU points on Chinese$\leftrightarrow$ English and English$\rightarrow$German translation tasks.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2018.2864648","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:6176116608,61672555,61432013,61732005); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Opening Project of Beijing Key Laboratory of Internet Culture and Digital Dissemination Research; Joint Project of Macao Science and Technology Development Fund and National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:045/2017/AFJ); Multiyear Research Grant from the University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00087-FST,MYRG2015-00175-FST,MYRG2015-00188-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8430540","Attention gate;knowledge block;knowledge gate;neural machine translation (NMT)","Linguistics;Syntactics;Decoding;Speech processing;Recurrent neural networks;Encoding","encoding;language translation;linguistics;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets","linguistic knowledge-aware neural machine translation;NMT encoder;syntactic information;word embeddings;word representation;knowledge-aware NMT approach;recurrent neural network;RNN encoder;knowledge gate","","18","","54","IEEE","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using automatically labeled data for training, tuning and testing MT systems is beneficial on condition that labels are sufficiently accurate, typically above 70%. To reach such an accuracy, a large array of features for discourse connective labeling (morpho-syntactic, semantic and discursive) are extracted using state-of-the-art tools and exploited in factored MT models.

In this paper, we propose a novel OOD detection framework, which makes use of classification confidence scores of multiple topics and trains a linear discriminant in-domain verifier using gradient probabilistic descent (GPD). Training is based on deleted interpolation of the in-domain data, and thus does not require actual OOD data, providing high portability. Three topic classification schemes of word N-gram models, latent semantic analysis (LSA), and support vector machines (SVM) are evaluated, and SVM is shown to have the greatest discriminative ability. In an OOD detection task, the proposed approach achieves an absolute reduction in equal error rate (EER) of 6.5% compared to a baseline method based on a simple combination of multiple-topic classifications. Furthermore, comparison with a system trained using OOD data demonstrates that the proposed training scheme realizes comparable performance while requiring no knowledge of the OOD data set.","1520-6149","0-7803-8484-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1326096","","Natural languages;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Routing;Informatics;Laboratories;Mathematics;Interpolation;User interfaces;Predictive models","speech recognition;error statistics;pattern classification;support vector machines;gradient methods;interpolation","out-of-domain detection;multiple topic classification;linear discriminant;in-domain verifier;GPD;deleted interpolation;portability;word N-gram models;LSA;SVM;EER reduction;equal error rate;performance;gradient probabilistic descent;latent semantic analysis;support vector machines;spoken language systems;classification confidence scores","","3","2","8","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many researchers have worked on different approaches in an attempt to reduce the level of noise in audio signals. Such approaches, among others, include Wavelet, Fourier Transform (FT), and deep learning. These algorithms worked well on noisy speech to a certain degree, but their degree of accuracy is not sufficient enough for speech-to-speech (S2S) translation because the presence of just a little noise in the signal can alter the semantic representation of the underlying language. Since it is nearly impossible for any of this single algorithm to produce a perfect (noiseless) signal, this paper presents a layered approach for total noise removal by stacking Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). In this approach, a band-pass channel is created using STFT, which reduces the signal noise level to the barest minimum while the residual noise is completely removed by performing PCA on the refined signals. Experimental results clearly showed that this approach almost doubles the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output signal for all the 10 audio samples being tested, thus making it relatively than the aforementioned approaches in terms of quality of outputs, and suitable for accuracy-sensitive domains such as speech-to-speech translation system development.","","979-8-3503-2478-5","10.1109/SEB-SDG57117.2023.10124385","Landmark University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10124385","Deep Learning;Fourier Transform;Machine Translation;Principal Component Analysis;Wavelet","Band-pass filters;Wavelet transforms;Fourier transforms;Noise reduction;Semantics;Wavelet analysis;Signal denoising","audio signal processing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Fourier transforms;image denoising;principal component analysis;signal denoising;wavelet transforms","10 audio samples;aforementioned approaches;audio signal;layered approach;noisy speech;output signal;perfect signal;Principal Component Analysis;refined signals;residual noise;Short Time Fourier Transform;signal noise level;signal-to-noise ratio;speech-to-speech translation system development;total noise removal","","","","26","IEEE","22 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One popular framework models the translation process end-to-end using attentional encoder-decoder architecture and treats each word in the vectors of intermediate representation. These embedding vectors are sensitive to the meaning of words and allow semantically similar words to be near each other in the vector spaces and share their statistical power. Unfortunately, the model often maps such similar words too closely, which complicates distinguishing them. Consequently, NMT systems often mistranslate words that seem natural in the context but do not reflect the content of the source sentence. Incorporating auxiliary information usually enhances the discriminability. In this research, we integrate acoustic information within NMT by multi-task learning. Here, our model learns how to embed and translate word sequences based on their acoustic and semantic differences by helping it choose the correct output word based on its meaning and pronunciation. Our experiment results show that our proposed approach provides more significant improvement than the standard text-based transformer NMT model in BLEU score evaluation.","","978-1-7281-0306-8","10.1109/ASRU46091.2019.9003802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9003802","Neural machine translation;acoustic and semantic embedding representation","Decoding;Acoustics;Training;Standards;Computer architecture;Dairy products;Semantics","decoding;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;sequences;vectors","neural machine translation;acoustic embedding;translation process end-to-end;attentional encoder-decoder architecture;embedding vectors;vector spaces;NMT systems;acoustic information;word sequences;acoustic differences;semantic differences;correct output word;standard text-based transformer NMT model","","1","","36","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evolution from simple token-based to segment-based to tree-based syntactic SMT is sketched. For tree-based SMT, we consider language bias rationales for selecting the degree of compositional power within the hierarchy of expressiveness for transduction grammars (or synchronous grammars). This leads us to inversion transductions and the ITG model prevalent in current state-of-the-art SMT, along with the underlying ITG hypothesis, which posits a language universal. Against this backdrop, we enumerate a set of key open questions for syntactic SMT. We then consider the more recent area of semantic SMT. We list principles for successful application of sense disambiguation models to semantic SMT, and describe early directions in the use of semantic role labeling for semantic SMT.","","978-1-4244-5478-5","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373509","","Statistics;Surface-mount technology;Space technology;Machine learning;Humans;Computer science;Labeling;Hardware;Speech recognition;Pattern recognition","computational linguistics;language translation;programming language semantics;statistics","toward machine translation;statistics;syntax;semantics;statistical machine translation;three dimensional MT model space;socio geographical conceptual;token based evolution;tree based syntactic SMT;hierarchy transduction grammars;inversion transductions;set key open;sense disambiguation models;SMT semantic","","3","","54","IEEE","8 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of this work has focused on the simplest class of deterministic state machines, that is deterministic finite automata and Mealy (or Moore) machines. The class of translations these machines can perform is very limited, mainly because these machines output symbols at the same rate as they input symbols, and therefore, the input and the translation have the same length; one may call these translations synchronous. Real-life translations are more complex: word reorderings, deletions, and insertions are common in natural-language translations; or, in speech-to-phoneme conversion, the number of frames corresponding to each phoneme is different and depends on the particular speaker or word. There are, however, simple deterministic, finite-state machines (extensions of Mealy machines) that may perform these classes of ""asynchronous"" or ""time-warped"" translations. A simple DTRNN model with input and output control lines inspired on this class of machines is presented and successfully applied to simple asynchronous translation tasks with interesting results regarding generalization. Training of these nets from input-output pairs is complicated by the fact that the time alignment between the target output sequence and the input sequence is unknown and has to be learned: we propose a new error function to tackle this problem. This approach to the induction of asynchronous translators is discussed in connection with other approaches.","","0-7803-4122-8","10.1109/ICNN.1997.614693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=614693","","Recurrent neural networks;Automata;Informatics;Computer networks;Hafnium;Inference algorithms","recurrent neural nets;finite state machines;multilayer perceptrons;learning (artificial intelligence);generalisation (artificial intelligence)","asynchronous translations;recurrent neural nets;discrete-time recurrent neural networks;finite-state machines;computational equivalence;deterministic finite automata;Mealy machines;Moore machines;word reorderings;natural-language translations;speech-to-phoneme conversion;deterministic finite-state machines;time-warped translations","","12","3","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware recurrent encoder (CAEncoder), as an alternative to the widely-used bidirectional encoder, such that the future and history contexts can be fully incorporated into the learned source representations. Our CAEncoder involves a two-level hierarchy: The bottom level summarizes the history information, whereas the upper level assembles the summarized history and future context into source representations. Additionally, CAEncoder is as efficient as the bidirectional RNN encoder in terms of both training and decoding. Experiments on both Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks show that CAEncoder achieves significant improvements over the bidirectional RNN encoder on a widely-used NMT system.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2017.2751420","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672440,61622209,61403269); Scientific Research Project of National Language Committee of China(grant numbers:YB135-49); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2016J05161); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031316","Context-aware encoder;neural machine translation (NMT);natural language processing;recurrent encoder","Context awareness;Semantics;Training;Computer architecture;Logic gates;Decoding;Computational modeling;Natural language processing;Recurrent neural networks","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets","NMT encoders;context-dependent word representations;context-aware recurrent encoder;CAEncoder;bidirectional RNN encoder;English-German translation tasks;neural machine translation;recurrent neural networks;source representations learning","","42","","25","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spoken language identification is commonly used in speech translation systems, in multi-lingual speech recognition, and in speaker diarization. In the current paper, spoken language identification based on deep learning (DL) and the i-vector paradigm is presented. Specifically, a comparative study is reported, consisting of experiments on language identification using deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Also, the integration of the two methods into a complete system is investigated. Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of using DNN in spoken language identification. However, to date, the integration of CNN and i-vectors in language identification has not been investigated. The main advantage of using CNN is that fewer parameters are required compared to DNN. As a result, CNN is cheaper in terms of memory and the computational power needed. The proposed methods are evaluated on the NIST 2015 i-vector Machine Learning Challenge task for the recognition of 50 in-set languages. Using DNN, a 3.55% equal error rate (EER) was achieved. The EER when using CNN was 3.48%. When DNN and CNN systems were fused, an EER of 3.3% was obtained. The results are very promising, and they also show the effectiveness of using CNN and i-vectors in spoken language identification.

Furthermore, the translation model knowledge is not fully explored in previous approaches. To address these two problems, we propose in this paper an abstractive cross-language summarization framework. First, the source language documents are translated into target language with a machine translation system. Then, the method constructs a pool of bilingual concepts and facts represented by the bilingual elements of the source-side predicate-argument structures (PAS) and their target-side counterparts. Finally, new summary sentences are produced by fusing bilingual PAS elements with the integer linear programming algorithm to maximize both of the salience and translation quality of the PAS elements.

Moreover, the article provides the analysis of the influence of certain features on the morphological homonymy resolution. The precision of the proposed algorithm is sufficient for its use in the tasks of intellectual text processing texts, for example, in machine translation and summarization systems.

It is also important for living things to integrate multiple types of senses to understand their surroundings. In human communications, human beings must further integrate the multimodal senses of audition and vision to understand intention. In this paper, we describe speech related modalities since speech is the most important media to transmit human intention. To date, there have been a lot of studies concerning technologies in speech communications, but performance levels still have room for improvement. For instance, although speech recognition has achieved remarkable progress, the speech recognition performance still seriously degrades in acoustically adverse environments.

However, the translation rules such as the non-lexical rule “ VP→(x0x1,VP:x1PP:x0)” in string-to-tree models do not consider any lexicalized information on the source or target side. The rule is so generalized that any subtree rooted at VP can substitute for the nonterminal VP:x1. Because rules containing nonterminals are frequently used when generating the target-side tree structures, there is a risk that rules of this type will potentially be severely misused in decoding due to a lack of lexicalization guidance. In this article, inspired by lexicalized PCFG, which is widely used in monolingual parsing, we propose to upgrade the STSG (synchronous tree substitution grammars)-based syntax translation model with bilingually lexicalized STSG. Using the string-to-tree translation model as a case study, we present generative and discriminative models to integrate lexicalized STSG into the translation model. Both small- and large-scale experiments on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrate that the proposed lexicalized STSG can provide superior rule selection in decoding and substantially improve the translation quality.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2013.2255283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6490019","Bilingually lexicalized synchronous tree substitution grammars;discriminative model;generative model;syntax-based statistical machine translation","Grammar;Decoding;Vegetation;Adaptation models;Reliability;Training;Syntactics","computational linguistics;decoding;grammars;language translation;natural language processing;tree data structures","syntax-based translation;bilingually lexicalized synchronous tree substitution grammars;syntax-based models;translation performance improvement;grammatical modeling;translation rules;nonlexical rule;subtree;nonterminal VP;target-side tree structure generation;decoding;lexicalization guidance;lexicalized PCFG;monolingual parsing;syntax translation model;bilingually lexicalized STSG;string-to-tree translation model;generative models;discriminative models;large-scale experiments;small-scale experiments;Chinese-to-English translation;rule selection;translation quality improvement","","4","1","39","IEEE","28 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies either assume that the domain information is given and leverage the domain knowledge to guide the translation process, or suppose that the domain information is unknown and utilize the model to automatically recognize it. However, the cases are mixed in practical scenarios, which means that some sentences are labeled with domain information while others are unlabeled, which is beyond the capacity of the previous methods. In this paper, we propose a unified MDMT model with a mixture of sub-networks (experts) to address the cases with or without domain labels. The mixture of sub-networks in our MDMT model includes a shared expert and multiple domain-specific experts. For the inputs with domain labels, our MDMT model goes through the shared and the corresponding domain-specific experts. For the unlabeled inputs, our MDMT model activates all the experts, each of which makes a dynamic contribution. Experimental results on multiple diverse domains in De $\rightarrow$ En, Fr $\rightarrow$ En, and En $\rightarrow$ Ro demonstrate that our method can outperform the strong baselines in both scenarios with or without domain labels.

STD incorporates both semantic and lexical features (word embeddings and n-gram and word order) into one metric. It measures the semantic distance between the hypothesis and reference by calculating the minimum cumulative cost that the embedded n-grams of the hypothesis need to “travel” to reach the embedded n-grams of the reference.

In this paper, we hypothesis that the optimal threshold for high performance with low latency depends on the input sequence, and propose an adaptive algorithm that learns how long to wait depending on input tokens by introducing a threshold prediction module.

This treatment also allows the sentences to be semantically interpreted and hermeneutically analyzed within the temporal movement of speech act for machine interpretation.

Also, thanks to the CxAxQ metatheorem, the systems' inherent limits have been clarified, and design choices can now be made in an informed manner according to the translation situations. MT evaluation has also matured: tools based on reference translations are useful for measuring progress; those based on subjective judgments for estimating future usage quality; and task-related objective measures (such as post-editing distances) for measuring operational quality. Moreover, the same technological advances that have led to “Web 2.0” have brought several futuristic predictions to fruition. Free Web MT services have democratized assimilation MT beyond belief. Speech translation research has given rise to usable systems for restricted tasks running on PDAs or on mobile phones connected to servers. New man-machine interface techniques have made interactive disambiguation usable in large-coverage multimodal MT. Increases in computing power have made statistical methods workable, and have led to the possibility of building low-linguistic-quality but still useful MT systems by machine learning from aligned bilingual corpora (SMT, EBMT). In parallel, progress has been made in developing interlingua-based MT systems, using hybrid methods. Unfortunately, many misconceptions about MT have spread among the public, and even among MT researchers, because of ignorance of the past and present of MT R&D. A compensating factor is the willingness of end users to freely contribute to building essential parts of the linguistic knowledge needed to construct MT systems, whether corpus-related or lexical. Finally, some developments we anticipated fifteen years ago have not yet materialized, such as online writing tools equipped with interactive disambiguation, and as a corollary the possibility of transforming source documents into self-explaining documents (SEDs) and of producing corresponding SEDs fully automatically in several target languages. These visions should now be realized, thanks to the evolution of Web programming and multilingual NLP techniques, leading towards a true Semantic Web, “Web 3.0”, which will support ubilingual (ubiquitous multilingual) computing.","","978-1-4244-6899-7","10.1109/NLPKE.2010.5587865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587865","MT;linguistic architecture;computational architecture;operational architecture;task-related evaluation;speech MT;interactive disambiguation;self-explaining documents;Semantic Web MT","Computer architecture;Pragmatics;Speech recognition;Dictionaries;Humans;Speech;Internet","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;semantic Web","Systran MT server;CxAxQ metatheorem;speech translation research;man-machine interface techniques;machine learning;self-explaining documents;multilingual NLP techniques;semantic Web;machine translation;Web 2.0","","2","","91","IEEE","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We utilize the Thai and English grammatical knowledge i.e. tense, part of speech (POS), and question inversion pattern. The proposed method handles the difference of Thai and English interrogative sentences using sentence transformation, interrogative grammatical attribute extraction, and interrogative grammatical attribute annotation. This method works as a pre-processing of GIZA, a standard word co-occurrence alignment tool in SMT. We hypothesize that using grammatical knowledge as a pre-processing of GIZA can provide higher accuracy. We experiment by using 43,500 interrogative sentences to compare alignment result between interrogative sentences attached an interrogative grammatical label and interrogative sentences unattached interrogative grammatical label. The experimental results yield 95% of accuracy with significant improvement than the conventional one.

Since it is one among the first steps of any natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as machine translation, if any error happens for tagging the same will repeat in the whole NLP process. So far works had been done on POS tagging based on SVM, MBLP, HMM, Ngram. All of these methods were not fixing the problem of ambiguity. So for fixing ambiguity, we put forward a new Hybrid tagger for Malayalam. The combination of traditional rules and n-gram may produce better result compared to other methodologies. And also the ambiguity will be reduced by enriching the bigram dictionary. A bigram dictionary of co-occurring words are built with their tags. About 100000 more words are there in bigram dictionary. A corpus for Malayalam must be built which may be supposed to access by the model. It contains about 100000 words which are Malayalam words as well as the words originated from English. Since it's a hybrid tagger, we can take advantage of both traditional rules as well as bigrams. Also the heart of the research is the rule set, which contains 267 manually created rules. Rules can be applied with help of a morph analyzer. Rules are also used for tagging if bigram and corpus can't be referred for tagging. The proposed method when tested on 150 words, only 11 words were not identified, and obtained 90.5% accuracy. For the unidentified words, it can be caused by either the root word may not be in corpus or bigram, or the absence of rule. So adding the word, bigram or rule, we can improve the result and enhance the work. Addition is simple task. The size of bigram dictionary, corpus, and rule set and accuracy of morph analyzer influences the performance of the system.","","978-1-4799-8792-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275825","N-gram;Rule based tagger;Natural Language Processing;Parts Of Speech tagging;Bigram dictionary;Corpus","Tagging;Dictionaries;Speech;Training;Natural language processing;Accuracy;Hidden Markov models","natural language processing;support vector machines","hybrid parts of speech tagger;Malayalam language;natural language processing;NLP techniques;machine translation;POS tagging;SVM;MBLP;HMM;N-gram;bigram dictionary;morph analyzer;rule based tagger;memory based language processing","","5","","10","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Input text is first analyzed, matched against handcrafted patterns developed using regular expressions to detect any NSWs. Upon detection, NSWs are tokenized and classified into one of the semiotic classes and then if necessary, into one of the Luganda noun classes. These are subsequently verbalized, each according to its semiotic as well as noun class, and a new text file is produced.

Inspired by context-rich word-sense disambiguation techniques, machine translation (MT) researchers have successfully integrated various types of source language context into the PBSMT model to improve target phrase selection. Among the various types of lexical and syntactic features, lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of super tags that preserve long-range word-to-word dependencies in a sentence have proven to be effective. These rich contextual features are able to disambiguate a source phrase, on the basis of the local syntactic behaviour of that phrase. In addition to local contextual information, global contextual information such as the grammatical structure of a sentence, sentence length and n-gram word sequences could provide additional important information to enhance this phrase-sense disambiguation. In this work, we explore various sentence similarity features by measuring similarity between a source sentence to be translated with the source-side of the bilingual training sentences and integrate them directly into the PBSMT model. We performed experiments on an English-to-Chinese translation task by applying sentence-similarity features both individually, and collaboratively with super tag-based features. We evaluate the performance of our approach and report a statistically significant relative improvement of 5.25% BLEU score when adding a sentence-similarity feature together with a super tag-based feature.","","978-1-4244-9063-9","10.1109/IALP.2010.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5681568","sentence similarity;source context information;statistical machine translation","Training;Context;Context modeling;Syntactics;Grammar;Feature extraction;Computational modeling","language translation;natural language processing;statistical analysis","sentence similarity-based source context modelling;PBSMT;phrase-based statistical machine translation model;translation hypotheses;context-rich word-sense disambiguation techniques;target phrase selection;lexical syntactic descriptions;long-range word-to-word dependencies;grammatical structure;sentence length;n-gram word sequences;bilingual training sentences;English-to-Chinese translation task;sentence-similarity features;super tag-based features","","2","","13","IEEE","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has eight hidden layers, namely, two dense layers, convolutional layer, skip layer, mask layer, Bi-LSTM layer, attention layer, and pooling layer. SCBAMM makes better use of spatiotemporal information and captures emotion-related features more effectively. In addition, it solves the problems of gradient exploding and gradient vanishing in deep learning to some extent. On the databases EMO-DB and CASIA, the proposed model SCBAMM achieves an accuracy rate of 94.58% and 72.50%, respectively.

Detecting the speech activities of each person in a conversation is vital to downstream tasks, like natural language processing, machine translation, etc. People refer to the detection technology of ”who speak when” as speaker diarization (SD). Traditionally, diarization error rate (DER) has been used as the standard evaluation metric of SD systems for a long time. However, DER fails to give enough importance to short conversational phrases, which are short but important on the semantic level. Also, a carefully and accurately manually-annotated testing dataset suitable for evaluating the conversational SD technologies is still unavailable in the speech community. In this paper, we design and describe the Conversational Short-phrases Speaker Diarization (CSSD) task, which consists of training and testing datasets, evaluation metric and baselines. In the dataset aspect, despite the previously open-sourced 180-hour conversational MagicData-RAMC dataset, we prepare an individual 20-hour conversational speech test dataset with carefully and artificially verified speakers timestamps annotations for the CSSD task. In the metric aspect, we design the new conversational DER (CDER) evaluation metric, which calculates the SD accuracy at the utterance level. In the baseline aspect, we adopt a commonly used method: Variational Bayes HMM x-vector system, as the baseline of the CSSD task.

The best result shows we gain 1.89 BLEU percentage points over a state of the art HPBT baseline system without using multiple CWS results.","","978-0-7695-3904-1","10.1109/IALP.2009.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380785","Chinese word segmentation;SMT;feature blending;feature interpolation","Surface-mount technology;Natural languages;Interpolation;Support vector machines;Laboratories;Natural language processing;Speech processing;White spaces;Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models","language translation;word processing","statistical machine translation;Chinese word segmentation;Chinese to English language translation","","","","22","IEEE","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, we combine the automatic and manual approach to generate the shallow-transfer rule for English-to-Indonesian. Automatic generated rule is manually post-edited to improve its quality. We compare the performance of system when applying no rule (word-for-word translation), automatic rule and post-edited rule.

"Applying PSO to natural language processing tasks: Optimizing the identification of syntactic phrases","G.

This involves taking a limited-size training dataset, where sentences are split into syntactically motivated sentences, and learning how to best segment arbitrary sentences into their corresponding phrases. The extrapolation of phrases is needed in numerous applications involving the generation of texts in natural language. One such application is machine translation, namely the automatic translation of unconstrained text from a source language to a target language. The phrasing model to be learnt comprises a number of parameters which need to be optimized based on the training data. To that end, a machine learning approach has been developed, which is based on the concept of attractive and repulsive forces. Instead of previous efforts using manual tuning of the parameters, here PSO is used to achieve the optimization of the model parameters. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PSO approach is promising, giving the most accurate phrasing in this specific application, with statistically significant improvements over earlier results.","","978-1-5090-0623-6","10.1109/CEC.2016.7744011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7744011","parsing of natural language;machine translation;syntactically-derived phrasing;particle swarm optimization;parameter optimization","Training;Force;Optimization;Natural language processing;Syntactics;Particle swarm optimization","computational linguistics;extrapolation;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;particle swarm optimisation","PSO;natural language processing;syntactic phrases identification;particle swarm optimisation;phrasing model;linguistically-motivated phrases;syntactically motivated sentences;phrases extrapolation;machine translation;unconstrained text automatic translation;machine learning approach","","6","","28","IEEE","21 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Widening the NLP pipeline for spoken language processing","S. Bangalore",AT&T Labs - Research,"2006 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop","19 Mar 2007","2006","","","15","15","Summary form only given. A typical text-based natural language application (eg. machine translation, summarization, information extraction) consists of a pipeline of preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, named entity detection, chunking, parsing. Information flows downstream through the preprocessing steps along a narrow pipe: each step transforms a single input string into a single best solution string. However, this narrow pipe is limiting for two reasons: First, since each of the preprocessing steps are erroneous, producing a single best solution could magnify the error propogation down the pipeline. Second, the preprocessing steps are forced to resolve genuine ambiguity prematurely. While the widening of the pipeline can potentially benefit text-based language applications, it is imperative for spoken language processing where the output from the speech recognizer is typically a word lattice/graph. In this talk, we review how such a goal has been accomplished in tasks such as spoken language understanding, speech translation and multimodal language processing. We will also sketch methods that encode the preprocessing steps as finite-state transductions in order to exploit composition of finite-state transducers as a general constraint propogation method.","","1-4244-0872-5","10.1109/SLT.2006.326787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123350","","Pipelines;Natural languages;Speech processing;Data mining;Tagging;Data preprocessing;Speech recognition;Lattices;Transducers","language translation;natural language processing;pipeline processing;speech processing","NLP pipeline;spoken language processing;text-based natural language application;error propogation;speech translation;multimodal language processing;finite-state transducers","","","","","IEEE","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to increased social media use and worldwide communication, many individuals are using multiple languages in their daily communication, making this type of data even more crucial. Machine translation, speech recognition, and text categorization are just a few examples of natural language processing activities that can be performed on code-mixed data. Research on code-mixed data can also aid in the understanding of multilingual communication. In this paper, we present an empirical study on the problem of word-level language identification and text normalisation for Marathi-English code-mixed text.

In contrast to existing frameworks which learn a direct cross-lingual mapping of word embeddings from the source language to the target language, we train two autoencoders jointly to transform the source and the target monolingual word embeddings into a shared embedding space, where a word and its translation are close to each other. In this way, we capture the cross-lingual features of word embeddings from different languages and use them to induce bilingual lexicons.

"Improving transformer model translation for low resource South African languages using BERT","P. Chiguvare; C. W.

This paper investigates the improvement in transformer model translation for low resource South African languages when pre-trained models are used in language translation. A South African low resource language multilingual BERT, dubbed SALR-mBERT is pre-trained from scratch using all nine of the low resource South African languages. SALR-mBERT performs better than mBERT and the transformer models for language corpora with approximately less than 600000 sentences. SALR-mBERT obtained the best results for Sesotho, Ndebele, Swati and Venda. SALR-mBERT outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on language corpora with less than 600000 sentences by about 29% and also outperforms the transformer model by 50%. The transformer model translation obtained the best results compared to mBERT and the SALR-mBERT models for language corpora with more than 600000 sentences. The transformer obtained the best results followed by SALR-mBERT for Northern Sotho, Tsonga, Xhosa, Tswana and Zulu to English translations. The transformer model outperforms SALR-mBERT by 15% for Zulu which has the largest corpus size compared to other low resource South African languages. The main finding of this work is that the BERT type module is beneficial for machine translation if the corpus size is small and has less than approximately 600000 sentences, and further improvement can be gained when the BERT model is trained using languages of a similar nature like in the case of SALR-mBERT. However, transformer model translations outperform BERT model translations if the corpus size is greater than 600000 sentences.","","978-1-7281-9048-8","10.1109/SSCI50451.2021.9659923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9659923","pre-training;transformer model;multilingual BERT","Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Performance gain;Transformers;Machine translation;Task analysis;Computational intelligence","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;speech recognition","improving transformer model translation;low resource South African languages;natural language processing tasks;language translation;South African low resource language multilingual BERT;dubbed SALR-mBERT;language corpora;SALR-mBERT outperforms multilingual BERT;SALR-mBERT models;BERT model translations","","","","20","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many sparse features are highly overlapping with each other; that is, they cover the same or similar information of translational equivalence from slightly different points of view, and eventually overfit easily with only very feature training samples in given bilingual stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) rules. We propose a natural autoencoder that maps all the discrete and overlapping sparse features for each SCFG rule into a continuous vector, so that the information encoded in sparse feature vectors becomes a dense vector that may enjoy more samples during training and avoid overfitting. Our experiments showed that for a 33-million bilingual SCFG rules statistical machine translation system, the autoencoder generalizes much better than sparse features alone using the same optimization framework.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854978","machine translation;sparse features;SCFG grammar induction;optimization;autoencoder;PRO","Training;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Neural networks;Computational linguistics;Vectors;Tuning","context-free grammars;encoding;feature selection;language translation;natural language processing;optimisation;statistical analysis","autoencoder;bilingual sparse features;improved statistical machine translation;feature selection;feature engineering;optimization;translational equivalence;feature training sample;bilingual stochastic context-free grammar;SCFG rules;sparse feature vector;overfitting avoidance","","6","","17","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is one of the preprocessing steps in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as information retrieval and machine translation. Few studies have worked on Bantu Languages in automatic language identification. Language identification is a challenge in Bantu languages because of lack of data and in addition to that, languages which are written similarly like Setswana and Sesotho are also challenging. In this paper, we present a word-based Naïve Bayes classifier to identify words of Sesotho and Setswana language. The classifier was trained with words from both Setswana and Sesotho in a supervised manner. Adjectives, pronouns, adverbs and enumeratives are also included. The classifier shows that the two languages can be individually identified as it gives an accuracy of 71.4%. Despite that when we increase the data to double the number of words, the model increased performance to 78%. We also report that the classifier fails with homographs. The performance could be improved by using more data. Additionally, the syllable identification and sentence identification could be implemented along with word-based classifier.","2576-8581","978-1-905824-69-4","10.23919/IST-Africa56635.2022.9845618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9845618","Language Identification;NLP;Naïve Bayes;Setswana;Sesotho","Information filters;Data models;Machine translation;Task analysis","Bayes methods;information retrieval;language translation;natural language processing;pattern classification;speech processing;text analysis","sentence identification;word-based classifier;word-based Bantu Language identification;Natural Language Processing tasks;information retrieval;machine translation;Bantu Languages;automatic language identification;Bantu languages;word-based Naïve Bayes classifier;syllable identification","","","","19","","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, an adversarial mask mechanism is presented to deal with the shortcoming of random mask and accordingly enhance the robustness in word prediction for language understanding.

However, the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems bring about new challenges for question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g., question-answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issues. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via non-negative matrix factorization.

To alleviate the dearth of the parallel data available, we also augment the training data with sentences just with content word roots obtained from the original training data to bias root word alignment, and with highly reliable phrase-pairs from an earlier corpus alignment. We use a morpheme-based language model in decoding and a word-based language model in re-ranking the  $n$-best lists generated by the decoder.

Information criteria have been used to overcome this problem, but, theoretically, they cannot be applied to complicated models like HMMs. Recently, to avoid these problems, a VB approach has been developed in the machine-learning field. The successive state splitting (SSS) algorithm is a method of creating contextual and temporal variations for HMMs. We introduce the VB approach to the SSS algorithm, and define the prior and posterior probability densities and free energy as split and stop criteria.

These characteristics pose challenges, especially for low-latency scenarios, where the system is often required to be streaming. In this paper, we build a compact and streaming speech recognition system on top of the end-to-end neural transducer architecture [3] with attention-based modules augmented with convolution [2]. The proposed system equips the end-to-end models with the streaming capability and reduces the large footprint from the streaming attention-based model using augmented memory [4], [5].

This research study extends previous work to assess the efficacy of developing a bidirectional translator generator in Prolog programming language using Lexical Functional Grammars. The main research objective is building a machine translator generator for multilingual communication, i.e. developing a system whose inputs are linguistic descriptions of a desired source and target language and whose output is a program that translates between the two natural languages. The implementation of a bidirectional machine translator between English and Hungarian, developed as a proof-of-concept case study, is discussed and assessed in terms of four general classes of translation.

By combining the power of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics and computer science, natural language processing (NLP) helps machines “read” text by simulating the human ability to understand language. Part-of-speech tagging (POS Tagging) is done as a pre-requisite to simplify a lot of different NLP applications like question answering, speech recognition, machine translation, and so on. Here, we attempt a comparison between part-of-speech taggers in Malayalam using decision tree algorithm and bi-directional long short term memory (BLSTM).

We performed experiments on the English language MGB Challenge data, which comprises about 1,600h of BBC television recordings. Our results indicate that a lexical system, based on a neural machine translation approach is significantly better than other systems achieving an F-Measure of 62.6% on reference text, with a relative degradation of 19% on ASR output. Our analysis of the results in terms of specific punctuation indicated that using longer context improves the prediction of question marks and acoustic information improves prediction of exclamation marks.

A commonly practiced technique in text analytics is the extraction of stop words; words whose presence do not contribute context or information to a document. In this paper, we explore statistical techniques for the automated extraction of stop words, comparing 4 datasets from written and translated reviews. Using statistical variations of the successful technique `term ranking', we evaluate their performance using a common list of stop words. Results suggest that variation, TFnormIDFnorm, was the most successful with a best performing precision rate of 46.7% and a recall rate of 86.6%. The best results were seen in the largest dataset using written reviews, however comparison of the remaining 3 datasets revealed that spoken text performed 0.4% better in precision than the next best dataset and 2.6% better in recall.

With the advancement of globalization and the increase of cross-border communication, the accurate translation of English phrases has become particularly crucial. However, due to the complexity and polysemy of language, traditional Machine translation systems still have some difficulties in dealing with English phrases. This article introduces the application of computer intelligent proofreading system in English phrase translation. Firstly, the traditional Machine translation system is summarized, and the possible problems in English phrase translation, such as semantic ambiguity, vocabulary selection and Syntax error, are pointed out. Next, the working principle and application methods of the computer intelligent proofreading system were introduced. Computer intelligent proofreading system can automatically detect and correct errors in Machine translation results by combining Natural language processing and machine learning technology. This system can be trained based on a large-scale corpus to learn translation rules and accuracy in various contextual contexts. Finally, through experimental simulation, it can be seen that the algorithm proposed in this article achieves both accuracy and accuracy of over 95%.","","979-8-3503-0159-5","10.1109/ICDSNS58469.2023.10245870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10245870","computer;Intelligence;Proofreading system;English phrase translation","Vocabulary;Machine learning algorithms;Semantics;Globalization;Machine learning;Speech recognition;Manuals","","","","","","10","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We not only use Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a classifier, but also compare it with other methods, such as deep learning, CNN and DistilBERT. Apart from standard text preprocessing, we propose to accommodate the effect of translating in handling the multilingual content. The data transformation methods used in the SVM model are Label Power-set (LP) and Classifier Chains (CC). The experiment result shows that the classification using the SVM and CC without stemming, stopword removal, and translation provides the best accuracy of 74.88%. The best SVM hyperparameter on multilabel classification is the sigmoid kernel, the regularization parameter value of 10, and the gamma value of 0.1. Stemming, stopword removal, and translation preprocessing are less effective in this research. Moreover, CNN has a flaw in predicting labels for the training data with a low occurrence rate.","","978-1-7281-8235-3","10.1109/ICoDSA50139.2020.9212992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212992","classification;hate speech;social media;support vector machine","Support vector machines;Twitter;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Dictionaries;Forestry","computational linguistics;natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);support vector machines;text analysis","data transformation;classifier chains;multilabel classification;support vector machines;Indonesian hate speech;social media;social conflict;Indonesian language;Twitter;nonstandard text;text preprocessing;label power-set;multilingual content;SVM hyperparameter;sigmoid kernel;regularization parameter","","8","","17","IEEE","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, MvSR consists of two parts: (1) shared mask consistency: we forward the same target with different mask strategies, and encourage the predictions of shared mask positions to be consistent with each other. (2) model consistency, we maintain an exponential moving average of the model weights, and enforce the predictions to be consistent between the average model and the online model. Without changing the CMLM-based architecture, our approach achieves remarkable performance on three public benchmarks with 0.7-1.15 BLEU gains over previous NAT models.

However, the computational complexity of self-attention grows quadratically with the input sequence length. This can be particularly problematic for applications such as ASR, where an input sequence generated from an utterance can be relatively long. In this work, we propose a combination of restricted self-attention and a dilation mechanism, which we refer to as dilated self-attention. The restricted self-attention allows attention to neighboring frames of the query at a high resolution, and the dilation mechanism summarizes distant information to allow attending to it with a lower resolution. Different methods for summarizing distant frames are studied, such as subsampling, mean-pooling, and attention-based pooling. ASR results demonstrate substantial improvements compared to restricted self-attention alone, achieving similar results compared to full-sequence based self-attention with a fraction of the computational costs.","2379-190X","978-1-7281-7605-5","10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9415001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9415001","dilated self-attention;transformer;automatic speech recognition;computational complexity","Conferences;Neural networks;Signal processing;Acoustics;Computational efficiency;Machine translation;Speech processing","computational complexity;language translation;neural nets;speech recognition","dilated self-attention;restricted self-attention;dilation mechanism;attention-based pooling;ASR results;full-sequence based self-attention;multiresolution context;important used neural network component;widely used neural network component;automatic speech recognition;input sequence length","","4","","28","IEEE","13 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SLR is an important task in its own right, for example, as a tool to analyze or categorize large amounts of multi-lingual data. Further, it is also an essential tool for selecting downstream applications in a work flow, for example, to chose appropriate speech recognition or machine translation models. SLR systems are usually composed of two stages, one where an embedding representing the audio sample is extracted and a second one which computes the final scores for each language. In this work, we approach the SLR task as a detection problem and implement the second stage as a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) model. We show that discriminative training of the PLDA parameters gives large gains with respect to the usual generative training. Further, we propose a novel hierarchical approach where two PLDA models are trained, one to generate scores for clusters of highly-related languages and a second one to generate scores conditional to each cluster. The final language detection scores are computed as a combination of these two sets of scores. The complete model is trained discriminatively to optimize a cross-entropy objective. We show that this hierarchical approach consistently outperforms the non-hierarchical one for detection of highly related languages, in many cases by large margins. We train our systems on a collection of datasets including over 100 languages, and test them both on matched and mismatched conditions, showing that the gains are robust to condition mismatch.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3190736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9844653","Spoken language recognition;probabilistic linear discriminant analysis;discriminative training","Training;Computational modeling;Speech recognition;Detectors;Probabilistic logic;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine translation","entropy;feature extraction;language translation;natural language processing;speaker recognition;speech recognition;statistical analysis","discriminative hierarchical PLDA-based model;spoken language recognition;automatic process;speech sample;multilingual data;work flow;appropriate speech recognition;SLR systems;audio sample;final scores;SLR task;probabilistic linear discriminant analysis model;discriminative training;PLDA parameters;usual generative training;hierarchical approach;PLDA models;highly-related languages;final language detection scores;highly related languages","","1","","67","IEEE","28 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, to avoid these problems, the VB approach has been developed in the machine-learning field. We introduce the VB approach to the successive state splitting (SSS) algorithm, which can create both contextual and temporal variations for HMM. We define the prior and posterior probability densities and free energy with latent variables as split and stop criteria.

This is due to unclear or low-quality input, as well as training model on different frequencies but by using context some of the accuracy may improve. Context finding from binary files is a challenge as it works in temporal and space domain. Binary data like images contain special information, while audio files contain temporal information. Video files have both time and space domains. Updating context in the temporal domain, to find proper context from the audio corpus, speech recognition is applied.

This allows practitioners to represent their entire dataset using the least amount of tokens, thus avoiding memory and performance-related problems derived from the full wordor purely character-level representations. Even though there is strong evidence that each dataset has an optimal vocabulary size, in practice it is common to use as many “words” as possible. In this work, we show how this standard approach might be counter-productive for small datasets or low-resource environments, where models trained with quasi character-level vocabularies seem to con-sistently outperform models with large subword vocabularies.

About 80% of the sentences were correctly recognised, for a language having an average branching factor of 10. In the AESOP 1 system, sentence recognition is 90 %,(95% on words) for the same language. Apart from this improvement, the system has been designed to be used easily for artificial languages, by adding graceful interaction to define semantic grammar (including automatic grapheme-to-phoneme translation of the vocabulary) and talker adaptation. Simultaneously, we developed a method for diphone recognition of continuous speech, using a 1089-diphone dictionary. Although the results are presently mediocre on pure phoneme recognition, its use as the acoustic level of the SUS gave good results.

This algorithm is found to be very simple and computationally efficient. Various modifications are made in the spectral subtraction technique and therefore spectral over subtraction, improved spectral over subtraction, iterative spectral over subtraction and multiband spectral subtraction techniques are derived. In this paper basic performance of spectral subtraction, spectral over subtraction and improved spectral over subtraction technique and SS with cross spectral terms with non-stationary noisy database is discussed. It is observed that algorithm works effectively to reduce additive noise present in the noisy speech signal.

The training of APE models, generally require triplets including a source sentence ( $src$ ), machine translation sentence ( $mt$ ), and post-edited sentence ( $pe$ ). As considerable expert-level human labor is required in creating  $pe$ , APE researches have encountered difficulty in constructing suitable dataset for most of language pairs. This has led to the absence of APE data for most of language pairs, such as Korean-English, and imposed limitation to the sustainable researches of APE.

Our proposal comprises three noise generation techniques, including random, part of speech tagging (POS) based, and semantic level noises, and the effectiveness of these methods are verified by the results of quantitative and qualitative experiments on Korean-English APE tasks. As a result of our experiments, we find that POS based noise encourages the best APE performance. The proposed method is influential in that it can obviate expert human labor which was generally required in APE data construction, and enable the sustainable APE researches for the most language pairs where human-edited APE triplets are unavailable.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3152001","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program IITP-2018-0-01405 supervised by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government (MSIT) under IITP Grant 2020-0-00368 (A Neural-Symbolic Model for Knowledge Acquisition and Inference Techniques); MSIT under the ICT Creative Consilience Program IITP-2021-2020-0-01819 supervised by the IITP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714400","Automatic post editing;neural machine translation;data generation;machine translation;post editing","Mathematical models;Machine translation;Semantics;Training;Task analysis;Tagging;Planning","natural language processing","language pairs;noise generation techniques;semantic level noises;Korean-English APE tasks;APE performance;APE data construction;sustainable APE researches;human-edited APE triplets;data generation method;machine translation sentence;postedited sentence;automatic post editing;random noise;part of speech tagging based noise;POS based noise;semantic level noise","","3","","35","CCBY","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the course of learning, a machine makes a decision about whether an orally input word is a word in the lexicon the machine has learned using both speech and visual cues. Learning is carried out on-line, incrementally, based on a combination of active and unsupervised learning principles. If the machine judges with a high degree of confidence that its decision is correct, it learns the statistical models of the word and a corresponding image class as its meaning in an unsupervised way. Otherwise, it asks the user a question in an active way. The function used to estimate the degree of confidence is also learned adaptively on-line. Experimental results show that the method enables a machine and a user to adapt to each other, which makes the learning process more efficient.","","0-7803-8570-5","10.1109/ROMAN.2004.1374800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374800","","Unsupervised learning;Natural languages;Machine learning;Speech;Learning systems;Man machine systems;Ubiquitous computing;Humans;Robot sensing systems;Intelligent robots","speech-based user interfaces;speech processing;unsupervised learning;decision making;statistical analysis","unsupervised learning;spoken word acquisition;human-machine multimodal interfaces;interactive learning;decision making;adaptive online learning;statistical word models","","12","","14","IEEE","10 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This prohibits their incorporation into standard linear-time decoders. In this paper, we present an incremental, linear-time dependency parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and classification techniques. We devise a deterministic transform of CCG-bank canonical derivations into incremental ones, and train our parser on this data.

We first show that a restriction of the employed temporal context in the self-attention layers of a CNN-based network architecture is crucial for good speech enhancement performance. Furthermore, we propose to combine restricted attention with a subsampled attention variant that considers long-term context with a lower temporal resolution, which helps to effectively consider both long- and short-term context.

These methods include classical, well-known generative and discriminative methods like Finite State Transducers (FSTs), Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as techniques recently applied to natural language processing such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Following a detailed description of the models, experimental and comparative results are presented on three corpora in different languages and with different complexity. The French MEDIA corpus has already been exploited during an evaluation campaign and so a direct comparison with existing benchmarks is possible. Recently collected Italian and Polish corpora are used to test the robustness and portability of the modeling approaches. For all tasks, manual transcriptions as well as ASR inputs are considered. Additionally to single systems, methods for system combination are investigated. The best performing model on all tasks is based on conditional random fields. On the MEDIA evaluation corpus, a concept error rate of 12.6% could be achieved. Here, additionally to attribute names, attribute values have been extracted using a combination of a rule-based and a statistical approach. Applying system combination using weighted ROVER with all six systems, the concept error rate (CER) drops to 12.0%.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2093520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5639034","Generative and discriminative models;spoken dialogue systems;system combination","Hidden Markov models;Semantics;Media;Speech recognition;Speech processing;Speech;Support vector machines","interactive systems;Markov processes;maximum entropy methods;natural language processing;speech recognition","stochastic approach;multiple language;spoken language understanding module;dialogue system;word sequence;automatic speech recognition system;concept tagging;generative method;discriminative method;finite state transducer;statistical machine translation;maximum entropy Markov model;support vector machine;natural language processing;conditional random field;dynamic Bayesian network;French MEDIA evaluation corpus;portability;concept error rate","","34","4","49","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

POS tagging is used as an early stage of linguistic text analysis in many applications. POS tagging is a process of assigning correct syntactic categories to each word. Tagsets and word disambiguation rules are fundamental parts of any POS tagger. This paper presents a new approach for POS tagging of Myanmar Language. Firstly, Users input a simple Myanmar sentence and then this sentence is segmented into words by using segmentation rules. These words are assigned to appropriate syntactic categories of Myanmar language by using rule based and probabilistic approach. This system applied CRF method for tagging POS ambiguities on words. CRF is a framework for building discriminative probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequential data. The tagsets for Myanmar POS, segmentation rule, tagging algorithm and CRF method are designed. The proposed approach is used UCSM Lexicon. So, this hybrid approach for POS tagging can give the optimal accuracy and robustness of machine translation system.","","978-1-4244-9283-1","10.1109/CAMAN.2011.5778890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5778890","","Tagging;Speech;Accuracy;Probabilistic logic;Syntactics;Grammar;Training data","knowledge based systems;language translation;probability;text analysis","part-of-speech tagging;Burmese texts;English;language translation system;linguistic text analysis;syntactic categories;Myanmar language;Myanmar sentence;segmentation rules;rule based approach;probabilistic approach;CRF method;UCSM Lexicon","","4","","8","IEEE","27 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, such a preprocessing framework for detecting silence parts in an audio signal is considered. It is shown that further statistical analysis on the silence distributions results in detecting interesting audio features which can help in finding audio recordings which do not have actual speech sound but a fax machine tone sequence.

One technique makes use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using word or subword units. Word-based RNNs keep the same system vocabulary, so they cannot reduce the OOV, whereas subword units can reduce the OOV but generate many false combinations. A complementary technique is based on automatic machine translation, which requires parallel texts and is able to add words to the vocabulary. These methods were assessed on 10 languages in the context of the Babel program and NIST OpenKWS evaluation. Although improvements vary across languages with both methods, small gains were generally observed in terms of word error rate reduction and improved keyword search performance.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-4117-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953266","multilingual;low resourced languages;speech recognition;keyword search","Training;Vocabulary;Data models;Keyword search;Recurrent neural networks;NIST;Error analysis","natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","language model data augmentation;low-resourced STT;KWS;low-resourced automatic speech recognition;keyword search;out-of-vocabulary rates;language model estimates;recurrent neural networks;word-based RNN;complementary technique;automatic machine translation;Babel program;NIST OpenKWS evaluation;word error rate reduction","","3","","24","IEEE","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present work attempts to build an automatic translation system for conversion of text from English to Hindi. Several works related to Machine Translation have also been presented here. Firstly we take a text as input in English, store it in a file, extract words and punctuations from it and store them in an array, then we do grouping of words, find their meanings in context to the sentence and convert it to the target language i.e. Hindi. During this translation we also deal with several issues like word order, word sense, ambiguity and idioms.

However, there still remain some problems with regard to translation of inflected words, processing of multitranslatable words and so on. In this paper, we propose a new method for Japanese-Korean machine translation by using the relationships of two neighboring words. To solve the problems, we investigate the connection rules of auxiliary verb priority. And we design the translation table, which consists of entry tables and connection form tables. For unambiguous words, we can translate a Japanese word to the corresponding Korean word in terms of direct-matching method by consulting the only entry table. Otherwise, we have to evaluate the connection value computed from connection form tables and then we can select the most appropriate target word.","","0-7695-2674-8","10.1109/ICHIT.2006.253663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021268","","Natural languages;Dictionaries;Information analysis;Data mining;Pattern matching;Information technology;Speech;Humans","","","","1","","15","IEEE","12 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed methods for a fast and low cost SLU language portability. In addition, we propose two methods to increase SLU robustness to translation errors. Overall, it is shown that the combination of all these approaches can further reduce the concept error rate. While most of the experiments in this paper deal with portability from French to Italian (given the availability of the Media French corpus and its subset manually translated into Italian), a validation of our methodology is eventually proposed in Arabic.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2012.2229983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6362182","Language portability;spoken dialogue systems;spoken language understanding;statistical machine translation","Humans;Adaptation models;Buildings;Availability;Speech;Training;Training data","language translation;natural language processing;random processes","lightly supervised approach;language portability;spoken language understanding system;spoken dialogue system;SDS;SLU module;time reduce;cost reduce;conceptual decoding;conditional random fields;CRF;phrase-based statistical machine translation;PB-SMT;translation errors;concept error rate reduction;Media French corpus;Italian Language;Arabic Language","","9","","43","IEEE","27 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Neural decoding of speech using such non-invasive techniques necessitates the optimal choice of signal analysis and translation protocols. By employing selection-by-exclusion based temporal modeling algorithms, we discover fundamental syllable-like units that reveal similar set of signal signatures across all the three phases. Significantly higher than chance accuracies are recorded for single trial multi-unit EEG classification using machine learning approaches over three datasets across 30 subjects.

The most recent successful enrichments of PBSMT with hierarchical structure either employ nonlinguistically motivated syntax for capturing hierarchical reordering phenomena, or extend the phrase translation table with redundantly ambiguous syntactic structures over phrase pairs. In this paper, we present an extended, harmonized account of our previous work which showed that incorporating linguistically motivated lexical syntactic descriptions, called supertags, can yield significantly better PBSMT systems at insignificant extra computational cost. We describe a novel PBSMT model that integrates supertags into the target language model and the target side of the translation model. Two kinds of supertags are employed: those from lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar and combinatory categorial grammar. Despite the differences between the two sets of supertags, they give similar improvements. In addition to integrating the Markov supertagging approach in PBSMT, we explore the utility of a new surface grammaticality measure based on combinatory operators. We perform various experiments on the Arabic-to-English NIST 2005 test set addressing the issues of sparseness, scalability, and the utility of system subcomponents. We show that even when the parallel training data grows very large, the supertagged system retains a relatively stable absolute performance advantage over the unadorned PBSMT system. Arguably, this hints at a performance gap that cannot be bridged by acquiring more phrase pairs. Our best result shows a relative improvement of 6.1% over a state-of-the-art PBSMT model, which compares favorably with the leading systems on the NIST 2005 task. We also demonstrate that the advantages of a supertag-based system carry over to German-English, where improvements of up to 8.9% relative to the baseline system are observed.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2008.925870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599248","Combinatory categorical grammar (CCG);lexical syntax;lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG);statistical machine translation (SMT);syntax-based machine translation","Surface-mount technology;NIST;System testing;Scalability;Benchmark testing;System performance;Computational efficiency;Performance evaluation;Training data;Logic","grammars;language translation;natural language processing;trees (mathematics)","phrase-based statistical machine translation;syntactic knowledge;nonlinguistically motivated syntax;supertags;target language model;lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar;combinatory categorial grammar;Markov supertagging approach","","7","","52","IEEE","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We augment this data with other sources, but lack pronunciations for unseen words in the new audio and associated text. Four methods are investigated for generating these pronunciations, or baseforms: an heuristic grapheme to phoneme map, manual annotation, and two methods based on statistical models. The first of these uses a joint Maximum Entropy N-gram model while the other is based on a log-linear Statistical Machine Translation model. We report results on a state of the art, discriminatively trained, ASR system and show that the manual and statistical methods provide an improvement over the grapheme to phoneme map. Moreover, we demonstrate that the automatic statistical methods can perform as well or better than manual generation by native speakers, even in the case where we have a significant number of high quality, manually generated pronunciations beyond those provided by the TRANSTAC program.","","978-1-4673-0367-5","10.1109/ASRU.2011.6163939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6163939","","Manuals;Context;Training;Humans;Acoustics;Data models;Statistical analysis","entropy;speech recognition;statistical analysis","statistical pronunciation derivation;Pashto;ASR system;decoding;speech to speech translation system;TRANSTAC;maximum entropy N-gram model;log-in linear statistical machine translation model;phoneme;grapheme;automatic statistical methods;automatic speech recognition","","","","16","IEEE","5 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are foreign students in almost every school in Taiwan. Although they would go to a language school for Chinese classes before coming to Taiwan, each teacher's speaking speed and accent are different, and many technical terms are not taught in a language school. This causes the efficiency of learning to be greatly reduced. However, in order to allow foreign students to understand the content of the class, the switch to teaching in English has caused local students with poor English proficiency to be unable to understand the content of the class. Similarly, in Taiwan, not every subject taken by foreign students is taught in English. The official language, Chinese, is still the main communication tool in Taiwan. In order to improve the learning effectiveness of foreign students and local students in a bilingual environment and to deal with the learning problems caused by insufficient language skills, we have proposed solutions. This solution uses voice recognition and text translation technology, through the teacher’s microphone for the real-time simultaneous translation and recording of class content.

The sign language (i.e., hand movements) are used for the dumb and deaf to pass their messages. These people’s faces lots of challenges on daily basis due to the relative absence of widespread sign language use in society. The helplessness to talk seems like true impairment. People with this defacement communicate in entirely several means. There are a variety of choices present for communication where sign language is one of the ways. Applications existence for sign language is necessary for dumb people so that they become able to talk easily with them who does not know sign language motions. The objective here is to take the essential acts in sustaining the language gap between conventional people and verbally challenged people. Communication becomes extremely difficult for them, the chance that they can talk is through language of sign. Though a dumb or deaf person might know language of sign, the people with whom she wishes to speak might not. Our aim to overcome this difference by using machine learning and neural networks to analyze sign language and translate it to text and voice.","","978-1-6654-3811-7","10.1109/ICAC3N53548.2021.9725601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725601","Sign Language;Image Processing with CNN;Convolution Neural Networks;Recognition;Gesture Recognition;OpenCV;Video Processing using CNN","Uncertainty;Sociology;Neural networks;Process control;Gesture recognition;Auditory system;Assistive technologies","convolutional neural nets;handicapped aids;sign language recognition","CNN based speech-text translation;deaf person;dumb person;machine learning;normal peoples;sign language motions","","","","12","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are certain common errors that occur during writing such as missing letters, extra letters, disordered letters, and misspelled letters. These kind of common spelling errors are called phonetics spelling errors. These are of a major concern while dealing with phonetics. Out of various problems that the phoneticians are trying to solve, major portion of it concentrates on varieties of spelling errors. Phonetic structures are greatly emphasized based on the effectiveness, appropriateness and accuracy. In order to keep abreast with the changing and challenging trends of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is of great importance that one should resolve the problems of spelling errors. To achieve the goal, numerous realistic and practical approaches have to be adopted that make use of spelling correction algorithms such as Edit distance, Habit distance, Soundex and Asoundex. Through the analysis of these algorithms, a new interface is put forward that calculates the Edit distance, thereby showing the overall comparative study of phonetic algorithms with the proposed modified Edit Distance algorithm. The interface computes the Edit distance between two strings in appropriate and intuitive way, contemplating with the comparisons shown in the distance table. The Results show that an average of 0.937 recall and 0.947 precision have been achieved with the F-measure 0.9417. Through these results, it is evident that the recall and F-measures are improved in the proposed Edit-Distance algorithm. The revised version of the edit distance algorithm consistently attains finer quality results in comparison with the traditional edit distance algorithm.","","978-1-4799-6805-3","10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218113","Ambiguity;Edit distance;Natural Language Processing (NLP);Phonetics","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Informatics;Natural language processing;Writing;Context;Accuracy","natural language processing;speech processing","phonetics machine translation metrics;natural language processing;modified edit distance algorithm;phonetics spelling errors;spelling correction algorithms;habit distance;Soundex;Asoundex;F-measures","","3","1","8","IEEE","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to achieve the sharing of knowledge across languages, ontologies that are typically only represented in English must be translated into different languages. Building a domain-specific translation system is necessary for ontology due to the extremely specialized vocabulary and absence of contextual information. In this paper, we introduce cross-lingual agreement to alleviate the aforementioned issues. We propose a method for representing ontology labels that constructs agreement constraint objects by minimizing the distances between source and target sides. We also integrate with adversarial learning to reduce the difference between the ontology label and the hypothesis generated by the translation model during the fine-tuning. Finally, the agreement modeling strategy is incorporated into the decoding phase to guide the generation of translation candidates. Experiments on the four domains English-to-German ontology show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the baselines.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10094574","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10094574","ontology translation;cross-lingual agreement;adversarial learning;fusion decoding;cross-lingual alignment","Training;Vocabulary;Buildings;Ontologies;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Adversarial machine learning","","","","","","23","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we present a joint morphological-lexical language model (JMLLM) that takes advantage of Arabic morphology. JMLLM combines morphological segments with the underlying lexical items and additional available information sources with regards to morphological segments and lexical items in a single joint model. Joint representation and modeling of morphological and lexical items reduces the OOV rate and provides smooth probability estimates while keeping the predictive power of whole words. Speech recognition and machine translation experiments in dialectal-Arabic show improvements over word and morpheme based trigram language models.

Approaches in the literature for extending SLU models and grammars to new languages rely primarily on machine translation. This poses a challenge in scaling to new languages, as machine translation systems may not be reliable for several (especially low resource) languages. In this work, we examine different approaches to train a SLU component with little supervision for two new languages - Hindi and Turkish, and show that with only a few hundred labeled examples we can surpass the approaches proposed in the literature. Our experiments show that training a model bilingually (i.e., jointly with English), enables faster learning, in that the model requires fewer labeled instances in the target language to generalize. Qualitative analysis shows that rare slot types benefit the most from the bilingual training.","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461905","Spoken Language Understanding;Cross-Lingual;Slot-Filling;Intent Classification","Training;Training data;Data models;Task analysis;Google;Semantics;Reliability","interactive systems;language translation;natural language processing;query processing;speech recognition","Turkish;semantic representation format;natural language queries;SLU approaches;almost zero-shot cross-lingual spoken language understanding;Hindi;SLU component;machine translation systems;grammars;goal-oriented dialogue systems","","20","","25","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate whether these shrinkage-based techniques also perform well on larger training sets and on other domains. First, we explain why good performance on large data sets is uncertain, by showing that gains relative to a baseline n-gram model tend to decrease as training set size increases. Next, we evaluate several methods for data/model combination with Model M and rMDI models on limited-scale domains, to uncover which techniques should work best on large domains. Finally, we apply these methods on a variety of medium-to-large-scale domains covering several languages, and show that Model M consistently provides significant gains over existing language models for state-of-the-art systems in both speech recognition and machine translation.","","978-1-4244-5478-5","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373380","","Natural languages;Performance gain;Predictive models;Automatic speech recognition;Speech recognition;Interpolation;Acoustic testing;Training data;Large-scale systems","language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition","language model;regularized minimum discrimination information models;shrinkage-based techniques;speech recognition;machine translation","","14","","13","IEEE","8 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In multi-lingual domain classification, the training data for some poor-resource languages often comes from machine translation. Some of the higher order n-gram features are distorted during machine translation. Feature co-occurrence becomes reliable feature in multi-lingual domain classification. In this paper, in order to effectively model feature co-occurrences, we propose Factorization Networks that are combinations of Factorization Machines (FMs) with Neural Networks (NNs). FNs extend the linear connections from the input feature layer to the hidden layer in NNs to factorization connections that represent the weights of feature co-occurrences using factorized method. In addition to FNs, we also propose a hybrid model that integrates FNs, NNs and Maximum Entropy (ME) models together. The component models in the hybrid model share the same input features. Based on two data sets (ATIS data set and Microsoft Cortana Chinese data ), the proposed models shows promising results. Especially for large Microsoft Cortana Chinese data which is translated from well annotated English data, FNs using unigram, class and query length features achieve more than 20% relative error reduction over linear (SVMs).","2379-190X","978-1-4673-6997-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178978","Factorization Networks;Spoken Language Understanding;Domain Classification","Artificial neural networks;Support vector machines;Training data;Error analysis;Training;Polynomials","language translation;neural nets;pattern classification","multilingual domain classification;factorization network;spoken language understanding system;machine translation;higher order n-gram features;feature cooccurrence;factorization machines;neural networks;linear connections;maximum entropy;Microsoft Cortana Chinese data;ATIS data set","","1","","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we extend and improve the recent work on unsupervised learning of word alignment in Transformer on two dimensions: a) parameter initialization from a pre-trained cross-lingual language model to leverage large amounts of monolingual data for learning robust contextualized word representations, and b) regularization of the training objective to directly model characteristics of word alignments which results in favorable word alignments receiving more concentrated probabilities. Experiments on benchmark data sets of three language pairs show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce alignment error rate (AER) by at least 3.7 to 7.7 points on each language pair over two recent works on improving the Transformer's word alignment.

This conversion considers the phonological structure of the target language, as the transliterated output needs to be pronounceable in the target language. For example, a word in Vietnamese that begins with a consonant cluster is phonologically invalid and thus would be an incorrect output of a transliteration system. Most statistical transliteration approaches, albeit being widely adopted, do not explicitly model the target language's phonology, which often results in invalid outputs. The problem is compounded by the limited linguistic resources available when converting foreign words to transliterated words in the target language. In this paper, we present a phonology-augmented statistical framework suitable for transliteration, especially when only limited linguistic resources are available. We propose the concept of pseudo-syllables as structures representing how segments of a foreign word are organized according to the syllables of the target language's phonology.

However, there are also several challenges associated with creating and managing multilingual websites, including: Content creation, Technical implementation, implementing a multilingual website can be technically challenging, content optimization, Maintenance and updates. By taking a paragraph as input and processing the handwritten English characters, the article hopes to convert them into a computer-readable format paragraph with support for symbols and cursive writing, then train a neural network system to do so. Machine Learning algorithms (LSTM, FLITE, VAD, etc.) are studied for the various multilingual language conversion. The model is based on numerous natural language processing concepts and was created by adding multilingual capabilities to Google's previous Speech Recognition model. The article aims to develop a multilingual recognition model that will make it possible for non-readers to interact with digital devices in their native tongue.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10100287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100287","Globalization;Multilingual text;Natural Language Human Text;Deep Learning;Machine Learning","Machine learning algorithms;Tongue;Text recognition;Neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Symbols;Personal digital devices","deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","computer-readable format paragraph;Content creation;content optimization;creating managing multilingual websites;cursive writing;Deep Neural Networks;DNN;globalization;Google's previous Speech Recognition model;handwritten English characters;hard time;IT business;machine Learning;multilingual capabilities;multilingual global translation;multilingual language conversion;multilingual recognition model;multilingual website;neural network system;numerous natural language processing concepts;researched topics;Technical implementation;text recognition","","","","20","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Facebook, the most widely used social media platform has been the primary reason for the spread of hatred in Sri Lanka in the recent past. When a post with Sinhala hate content is reported on Facebook, it is translated to the English language before the review of the moderators. In most instances, the translated content has a different context compared to the original post. This results in concluding that the reported post does not violate the established policies and guidelines concerning hate content. Hence, an effective approach needs to be in place to address the aforementioned problem. This research project proposes a solution through an automated tool that is capable of detecting hate content presented in Sinhala phrases extracted from Facebook posts/memes. The tool accepts an image that contains Sinhala texts, extracts the text using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, preprocesses the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, analyzes the preprocessed text to identify hate intensity level and finally classifies the text into four main domains named Political, Race, Religion and Gender using a text classification model.","","978-1-6654-2000-6","10.1109/ICITR54349.2021.9657453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657453","Hate content;Facebook;Sinhala language;Convolutional Neural Network;Natural Language Processing;Text classifier model","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Text categorization;Hate speech;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;Internet;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","machine learning-based automated tool;social media;Sri Lanka;Sinhala hate content;English language;content translation;Sinhala phrases;Sinhala texts;convolutional neural network;natural language processing;text preprocessing;hate intensity level;text classification;Sinhala hate speech detection;Facebook posts;Facebook memes;political domain;race domain;religion domain;gender domain","","1","","22","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several methods, such as support vector machine and convolutional neural network-based models, achieve good VPD performance. To further improve the performance, we use a self-supervised pretrained model as feature representation instead of explicit speech features. When the pretrained model is fine-tuned for VPD, an overfitting problem occurs due to a domain shift from conversation speech to the VPD task. To mitigate this problem, we propose an adversarial task adaptive pretraining (A-TAPT) approach by incorporating adversarial regularization during the continual learning process. Experiments on VPD using the Saarbrucken Voice Database show that the proposed A-TAPT improves the unweighted average recall (UAR) by an absolute increase of 12.36% and 15.38% compared with SVM and ResNet50, respectively.

Apart from performance gains, attention weights assigned to input tokens are often utilized to explain that high-attention tokens contribute more to the prediction. However, many works question whether this assumption holds in text classification by manually manipulating attention weights and observing decision flips. This article extends this question to Transformer-based neural machine translation, which heavily relies on cross-lingual attention to produce accurate translations but is relatively understudied in this context. We first design a mask perturbation model which automatically assesses each input’s contribution to model outputs. We then test whether the token contributing most to the current translation receives the highest attention weight. We find that it sometimes does not, which closely depends on the entropy of attention weights, the syntactic role of the current generation, and language pairs. We also rethink the discrepancy between attention weights and word alignments from the view of unreliable attention weights. Our observations further motivate us to calibrate the cross-lingual multi-head attention by attaching more attention to indispensable tokens, whose removal leads to a dramatic performance drop. Empirical experiments on different-scale translation tasks and text summarization tasks demonstrate that our calibration methods significantly outperform strong baselines.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3180678","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62122088,U1836221,62006224); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792313","Attention mechanism;interpretability;Transformer;attention calibration","Graphics;Magnetization;Symbols;Magnetostatics;Speech processing;Permeability;Image color analysis","calibration;language translation;natural language processing;natural languages;text analysis","current translation;highest attention weight;unreliable attention weights;cross-lingual multihead attention;different-scale translation tasks;attention mechanism;different translations;high-attention tokens;Transformer-based neural machine translation;cross-lingual attention;accurate translations;token contributing","","1","","57","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because language information is not explicitly used, it may be morphological, syntactic or semantic. This paper designs an English machine translation model based on modern intelligent recognition technology. Through the direct maximum entropy model, we can get the best combination of different features in complex English sentences, eliminate some structural ambiguities and improve the accuracy of English machine translation.

We consider each of the modalities as different “languages” of the same brain and fit a translation model to estimate a model for how structure influences function. Results identify multiple aligned aspects of brain structure and functional brain states showing significantly more or less alignment in the patient group as well as interesting links to other variables such as cognitive scores and symptom assessments.

Despite advancement in information technology, simultaneous interpreters have not yet been provided with adequate tools to bring down the stress level that accompanies their profession. The booth setting and the way they perform have not been changed a lot over the years. Although a number of computer approaches have been presented to make the task of conference interpreters less challenging, most of them fail to meet their actual needs. Some of those approaches add to the pressure that interpreters are already under as they require human input, while others are restricted to certain languages. This paper proposes a new approach that makes use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) combined with a cloud-based machine translation (MT) that transcribes spoken words and provides in-depth translation in a contextual manner through the use of a compiled glossary. The proposed approach provides for the first time an instantaneous transcription of a speech, a domain detection through a part-of-speech tagger, and an adequate translation of the terminology used. Our approach has been tested in terms of transcription accuracy, domain extraction, and terminology identification and retrieval using English and Arabic speeches that cover different domains.","","978-1-7281-5260-8","10.1109/ICCES48960.2019.9068179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068179","Simultaneous interpreting;Natural Language Understanding (NLU);computer-assisted interpreting;named-entity-recognition;context extraction;part-of-speech tagger","Tools;Natural language processing;Automatic speech recognition;Dictionaries","language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition","simultaneous interpreters;automatic speech recognition;cloud-based machine translation;natural language understanding;simultaneous conference interpretation;information technology;ASR","","","","19","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing machine learning approaches have yielded only marginal success in learning speech-to-motion at the frame level. Current methods generate repetitive gesture sequences that lack appropriateness with respect to the speech context. To tackle this challenge, we take inspiration from successes in natural language processing on context and long-term dependencies, and propose a new framework that views text-to-gesture as machine translation, where gestures are words in another (non-verbal) language. We propose a vector-quantized variational autoencoder structure as well as training techniques to learn a rigorous representation of gesture sequences. We then translate input text into a discrete sequence of associated gesture chunks in the learned gesture space. Ultimately, we use translated gesture tokens from the input text as an input to the autoencoder's decoder to produce gesture sequences. Subjective and objective evaluations confirm the success of our approach in terms of appropriateness, human-likeness, and diversity. We also introduce new objective metrics using the quantized gesture representation.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981117","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN/06908-2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981117","","Representation learning;Training;Vocabulary;Vector quantization;Semantics;Clustering algorithms;Extraterrestrial measurements","gesture recognition;human computer interaction;human-robot interaction;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","associated gesture chunks;Co-speech Gesture Generation;Co-speech gestures;critical ingredients;discrete sequence;enhancing interaction experiences;gesture tokens;gesture2vec;human-agent interaction;human-likeness;input text;learned gesture space;machine learning approaches;machine translation;marginal success;natural language processing;principal component;quantized gesture representation;repetitive gesture sequences;representation learning methods;rigorous representation;speech context;speech-to-motion;text-to-gesture;vector-quantized variational autoencoder structure;virtual agents","","3","","72","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper thus proposes a visual representation method to explicitly enhance conventional word embedding with multiple-aspect senses from visual guidance. In detail, we build a small-scale word-image dictionary from a multimodal seed dataset where each word corresponds to diverse related images. Experiments on 12 natural language understanding and machine translation tasks further verify the effectiveness and the generalization capability of the proposed approach.

But it does not mean stop words removal can improve the performance of all types of applications in the area of NLP, Artificial Intelligence, Text Mining and Machine Translation. In context of Machine Translation (MT) stop words elimination process will lead to loss of accuracy, because each token has specific meaning which will be converted into target language. As on date there is no unique stop words list is available for Gujarati language with its lexical classes (Part-of-Speech Tags) to improve the performance of MT system. This paper present construction and categorization of stop words list for Gujarati language based on its lexical classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.) of Part-of-Speech family. We have prepared 126 raw text documents written in Gujarati language in which each document contained more than 260 tokens. After tokenization process, we got list of 32840 tokens. From the total number of tokens we created list of 1125 unique stop words with its lexical classes by manual inspection and help of linguistic experts.

Although each component in the pipeline has a clear function and mature solutions, it suffers from error propagation and scarcity of annotated training data. To solve it, we propose a monolithic network based on pre-trained models to accomplish the speech topic classification task. The end-to-end training strategy based on the unified network structure avoids error propagation. And the pre-trained models reduce the requirements for a large amount of annotated data. Besides, the proposed method can take advantage of the intrinsic semantic feature of the speech for better performance. Our method carried out a series of experiments on the Fisher dataset.

Text normalization is a preprocessing step to transform noisy words into their standard form and improve the performance of NLP applications, such as Sentiment Analysis, Part-of-speech Tagging, and Name Entity Recognition. However, less work utilizes Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approach to address text problems, specifically for short form and slang. In this work, three different NMT architectures are used to address the text problems. We conducted our experiments by training three different models under the same synthetic dataset. We prepared the dataset by collecting a local Malay news site which contains 46k of sentences and 800k words. The sentences are further processed using rule-based to create a parallel text. We then split the parallel text into training, validation, and test sets.

The foundation for many sophisticated applications of NLP, including named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, in-formation retrieval, and information processing, is laid by Part of Speech (POS) tagging, which is part of the lexical layer of NLP systems. In contrast to English, French, German, and other languages from the same geographical region, the development of high-accuracy, stable POS taggers for the Sinhala language is still in its early stages. Hence, Sinhala is identified as a low-resource language. The main objective of this research is to create a POS tagger for the Sinhala language to solve this issue. An innovative and novel strategy that has never been used with the Sinhala language has been designed. This approach has been suggested specifically to evaluate the possibility of enhancing the accuracy compared to other methodologies. So, deep learning algorithms have been applied in this study, which has a significant impact on improving tagger performance. First, highly accurate individual classifiers for primary POS tags were implemented, and then they were combined into one composite model. As expected, all individual classifiers and the final composite model have achieved a higher accuracy level. Thus, it demonstrates that the proposed solution using deep learning algorithms outperformed other methods, such as rule-based and stochastic, in terms of accuracy.","","978-1-6654-5699-9","10.1109/CSITSS57437.2022.10026395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026395","Natural Language Processing;NLP;Parts of Speech tagging;POS tagging;Sinhala;Deep Learning;Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Computational Linguistics","Deep learning;Sentiment analysis;Stochastic processes;Speech recognition;Tagging;Reflection;Classification algorithms","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;natural languages;pattern classification;text analysis","automated classification;deep learning algorithms;deep learning techniques;human languages;information processing;low-resource language;named entity recognition;Natural Language Processing;NLP systems;POS tagger;primary POS tags;reflection;Sinhala language;Sinhala Part;Speech tagger;Speech tagging;stable POS taggers;tagger performance","","","","23","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike acoustic hearing, sign language is a visual language that uses body language and physical communication to communicate effectively thoughts. It usually consists of hand gestures and facial expressions. Generally, communicating with different disabled people seems very difficult. This is because it takes a long time to learn the language, not just the language, people who are not disabled but also people who are. Establishment to communicate in such cases, both parties need to know sign language, or they use a human translator to make communication possible. Information Technologies with their own modern methods such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing has an amazing role to play in improving communication people with speech impairments and ordinary people. Sign language recognition can be done in two ways, glove-based or vision-based recognition. The solution proposed in this paper will produce software that takes over input in the form of speech and indicates appropriate Sign Language. The software is developed in Python platform to convert speech to Indian and American sign languages (ISL and ASL) which provides hearing impairment assistant. This software can be useful in many areas, such as in educational institutes, hospitals, police stations, and for general everyday life conversation.","","978-1-6654-1005-2","10.1109/ICICICT54557.2022.9917614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9917614","NLP;SLR;GUI;style;styling;insert","Visualization;Tongue;Law enforcement;Hospitals;Gesture recognition;Auditory system;Oral communication","cloud computing;feature extraction;gesture recognition;handicapped aids;hearing;human computer interaction;language translation;natural language processing;sign language recognition;visual languages","different disabled people;communication people;ordinary people;Sign language recognition;appropriate Sign Language;indian sign language converter;american sign language converter;mother tongue communication;visual language;body language;physical communication","","3","","15","IEEE","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model based on encoder-decoder architecture also takes as input the distributed representations of the source language which enriches the learnt dependencies and gives a warm start to the network. In this work, we transform Roman-Urdu to Urdu transliteration into sequence to sequence learning problem. To this end, we make the following contributions. We create the first ever parallel corpora of Roman-Urdu to Urdu, create the first ever distributed representation of Roman-Urdu and present the first neural machine translation model that transliterates text from Roman-Urdu to Urdu language. Our model has achieved the state-of-the-art results using BLEU as the evaluation metric. Precisely, our model is able to correctly predict sentences up to length 10 while achieving BLEU score of 48.6 on the test set.

Recently, researchers have adopted Neural Machine Translation (NMT) methods, which usually require large-scale corpus for training, to achieve SLT. However, the publicly available SLT corpus is very limited, which causes the collapse of the token representations and the inaccuracy of the generated tokens. To alleviate this issue, we propose Con-SLT, a novel token-level Contrastive learning framework for Sign Language Translation , which learns effective token representations by incorporating token-level contrastive learning into the SLT decoding process. Concretely, ConSLT treats each token and its counterpart generated by different dropout masks as positive pairs during decoding, and then randomly samples K tokens in the vocabulary that are not in the current sentence to construct negative examples. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmarks (PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily) for both end-to-end and cascaded settings. The experimental results demonstrate that ConSLT can achieve better translation quality than the strong baselines1.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10095466","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10095466","Sign language translation;low-resource;contrastive learning","Training;Representation learning;Vocabulary;Gesture recognition;Assistive technologies;Signal processing;Decoding","","","","1","","28","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition, can be solved in a form of sequence labeling problem. Other tasks such as constituency parsing and non-autoregressive machine translation can also be transformed into sequence labeling tasks. Neural models have been shown powerful for sequence labeling by employing a multi-layer sequence encoding network. Conditional random field (CRF) is proposed to enrich information over label sequences, yet it suffers large computational complexity and over-reliance on Marko assumption. To this end, we propose label attention network (LAN) to hierarchically refine representation of marginal label distributions bottom-up, enabling higher layers to learn more informed label sequence distribution based on information from lower layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAN through extensive experiments on various NLP tasks including POS tagging, NER, CCG supertagging, constituency parsing and non-autoregressive machine translation. Empirical results show that LAN not only improves the overall tagging accuracy with similar number of parameters, but also significantly speeds up the training and testing compared to CRF.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3145311","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976180); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9699087","Label attention;label dependency;sequence labeling","Labeling;Task analysis;Tagging;Artificial neural networks;Machine translation;Natural language processing;Encoding","grammars;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;natural language processing","label attention network;fundamental problem;natural language processing;NLP tasks;sequence labeling problem;constituency parsing;nonautoregressive machine translation;sequence labeling tasks;multilayer sequence encoding network;label sequences;LAN;informed label sequence distribution;conditional random field;CRF;Marko assumption;hierarchically refine representation;marginal label distributions;POS tagging;NER;CCG supertagging","","1","","85","IEEE","1 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing works attempt to improve the robustness of NMT normally via data augmentation, where synthetic noisy data are mixed with original clean data, either for training NMT with the standard NMT loss alone, or for tuning auxiliary tasks in a multi-task learning manner. Typical auxiliary tasks include detecting and correcting noises, exploiting noisy outputs for contrastive learning etc. The aforementioned two auxiliary tasks are generally designed independently, and the modules for detecting and correcting noises are heavyweight. In this article, we propose a new framework, DetTransNet (Detector-Translator Network), aiming to detect positions of noises in the input and translate the input simultaneously. The newly introduced noise detector module is essentially a lightweight binary classifier built upon the final layer of the encoder of the original Transformer model for the translation task, which is to identify at which position of the input has potential noise. The module has a very few parameters. In order to help the model capture the relationship between clean instances and their noisy counterparts, an extra loss is further introduced to enhance the interaction between clean and noisy data. In this way, we combine noise detection and contrastive learning together. As the model is able to identify and locate noises, a heuristic method is proposed to correct detected noises, in order to achieve better translations. Experiments show that DetTransNet is robust to four types of noises (deletion, insertion, swapping, keyboard), and obtain a substantial improvement of up to 1.6 BLEU points across different datasets.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2023.3284513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10147355","Neural machine translation;robust translation","Noise measurement;Machine translation;Task analysis;Training;Detectors;Transformers;Robustness","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To improve the learning of source sentence representations and handle the rare word problem of Low Resource Languages (LRLs), we propose a novel improvement in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-NMT by incorporating deep reinforcement learning-based optimised attention in generator and convolutional neural network in discriminator. We also create the novel joint embedding of subwords and sub-phonetic representation of sentences as input to GAN that helps models to learn the better representations and generate suitable context vectors compared to existing traditional approaches for LRLs.

The additional feedback from the other generation direction was used to regularize sequential learning in original direction of domain mapping. Domain matching between source sequence and target sequence was accordingly improved. However, the reconstructions for knowledge in two domains were ignored. The dual information based on separate models in two training directions was not sufficiently discovered. To cope with this weakness, this study proposes a closed-loop seq2seq learning where domain mapping and domain knowledge are jointly learned. In particular, a new feature-level dual learning is incorporated to build a dualformer where feature integration and feature reconstruction are further performed to bridge dual tasks.

Although there is a few POS Tagger in Bangla language, very small of them address the essence of suffices to identify tag of the words. In this regard, we propose an automated POS Tagging system for Bangla language based on word-suffixes. In our system, we use our own stemming technique to retrieve a possible minimum root words and apply rules according to different forms of suffixes. Moreover, we incorporate a Bangla vocabulary that contains more than 45,000 words with their default tag and a patterned based verb-data-set. These facilitate to improve tagging efficiency of Bangla POS Tagger. We experiment our proposed system on a Bangla text corpus.

Experiments show that the proposed model achieves substantial improvements on every test set over competitive baselines. Our contributions come from twofold. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to introduce the multi-sense representation, which represents each sense type of the word with a sense-specific embedding, into NMT.

By pooling the frame-level features, utterance-level representations, called d-vectors, can be derived and used in the automatic speaker verification (ASV) task. This simple average pooling, however, is inherently sensitive to the phonetic content of the utterance. An interesting idea borrowed from machine translation is the attention-based mechanism, where the contribution of an input word to the translation at a particular time is weighted by an attention score. This score reflects the relevance of the input word and the present translation. We can use the same idea to align utterances with different phonetic contents. This paper proposes a phonetic-attention scoring approach for d-vector systems. By this approach, an attention score is computed for each frame pair. This score reflects the similarity of the two frames in phonetic content, and is used to weigh the contribution of this frame pair in the utterance-based scoring. This new scoring approach emphasizes the frame pairs with similar phonetic contents, which essentially provides a soft alignment for utterances with any phonetic contents. Experimental results show that compared with the naive average pooling, this phonetic-attention scoring approach can deliver consistent performance improvement in ASV tasks of both text-dependent and text-independent.","2640-0103","978-1-7281-3248-8","10.1109/APSIPAASC47483.2019.9023352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9023352","","Phonetics;Task analysis;Decoding;Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Feature extraction;Neural networks","speaker recognition;vectors","d-vector systems;ASV;average pooling;attention score mechanism;utterance-based scoring;machine translation;automatic speaker verification;utterance-level representations;frame-level features;speech segmentation;deep neural network;frame-level deep speaker features;phonetic-attention scoring approach","","1","","27","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We further introduce data rejuvenation to improve the training of NLG models by re-labeling the inactive examples. The rejuvenated examples and active examples are combined to train a final NLG model.

In contrast to current VC techniques, our method 1) stabilizes and accelerates the training procedure by considering guided attention and proposed context preservation losses, 2) allows not only spectral envelopes but also fundamental frequency contours and durations of speech to be converted, 3) requires no context information such as phoneme labels, and 4) requires no time-aligned source and target speech data in advance. In our experiment, the proposed VC framework can be trained in only one day, using only one GPU of an NVIDIA Tesla K80, while the quality of the synthesized speech is higher than that of speech converted by Gaussian mixture model-based VC and is comparable to that of speech generated by recurrent neural network-based text-to-speech synthesis, which can be regarded as an upper limit on VC performance.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-8131-1","10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8683282","Voice conversion;deep learning;sequence-to-sequence;attention mechanism;context preservation mechanism","Training;Acoustics;Task analysis;Decoding;Linguistics;Artificial neural networks;Speech recognition","Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;recurrent neural nets;speech synthesis","Gaussian mixture model-based VC;recurrent neural network-based text-to-speech synthesis;VC performance;ATTS2S-VC;sequence-to-sequence voice conversion;context preservation mechanism;sequence-to-sequence learning;Seq2Seq;voice conversion tasks;machine translation;current VC techniques;context preservation losses;context information;time-aligned source;target speech data;VC framework;context preservation mechanisms;attention preservation mechanisms;image captioning;training procedure;spectral envelopes;fundamental frequency contours;NVIDIA Tesla K80;GPU;phoneme labels","","52","","52","IEEE","16 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Well, that's an exaggeration. But funder-promoted, common evaluations have profoundly affected our research in years past. In these evaluations, researchers agree on a number of tasks and criteria for success, then work independently on those tasks. In many cases, funding agencies provide sample inputs and outputs in advance, but withhold test data until ""evaluation day"". Several months later, participating researchers gather at a specialized workshop to discuss results and techniques. Whether you're interested in machine translation, morphology, speech-query processing, information extraction, or information retrieval, there is a common evaluation somewhere where you can test your ideas in an empirical, quantitatively scored setting.

While the ability of handling long-term dependency in data is the key for the success of RNN, combating over-fitting in training the models is a critical issue for achieving the cutting-edge performance particularly when the depth and size of the network increase. To that end, there have been some attempts to apply the dropout, a popular regularization scheme for the feed-forward neural networks, to RNNs, but they do not perform as well as other regularization scheme such as weight noise injection. In this paper, we propose rnnDrop, a novel variant of the dropout tailored for RNNs. Unlike the existing methods where dropout is applied only to the non-recurrent connections, the proposed method applies dropout to the recurrent connections as well in such a way that RNNs generalize well. Our experiments show that rnnDrop is a better regularization method than others including weight noise injection. Namely, when deep bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs were trained with rnnDrop as acoustic models for phoneme and speech recognition, they significantly outperformed the current state-of-the-arts; we achieved the phoneme error rate of 16.29% on the TIMIT core test set for phoneme recognition and the word error rate of 5.53% on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset, dev93, for speech recognition, which are the best reported results on both of the datasets.","","978-1-4799-7291-3","10.1109/ASRU.2015.7404775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7404775","Recurrent neural networks;LSTM;Dropout;rnnDrop","Training;Speech recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Logic gates","feedforward neural nets;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","RNNS;ASR;recurrent neural network;popular regularization scheme;feed-forward neural network;rnnDrop;weight noise injection;deep bidirectional long short-term memory RNN;deep bidirectional LSTM RNN;acoustic model;speech recognition;phoneme error rate;TIMIT core test set;phoneme recognition;Wall Street Journal dataset;WSJ dataset","","38","","24","IEEE","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, analysis on the Transformer layers has shown that different levels of information, e.g., phoneme level, word level and semantic level, are represented at different layers. Effectively integrating information from various levels is important for structured prediction. However, the self-attention in the conventional Transformer structure only focuses on intra-layer integration, and does not explicitly model inter-layer information relationships. Also, attention across the encoder and decoder (cross-coder) only focuses on the top encoder layer but ignores the intermediate layers. In this paper, we propose a sequence modeling structure equipped with a hierarchical attention mechanism, named Hiformer, that can consider the inter-layer and cross-coder hierarchical information to improve structured prediction performance.

This study presents an analysis and preprocessing system for audio inputs that express the Arabic dialects within 8 Arab dialects. The dataset contains 672 data and eight main subgroups, 84 samples for each of the eight Arabic dialects. Arabic dialect features are extracted and modeled using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques. The study shows the suitability and efficiency of the system, deep learning models are used instead of machine learning models. The overall results reveal that CNN’s implementation of our proposed system for identifying Arabic dialects reaches a degree of accuracy of 83%. This paper has proposed a system that showed its superiority in performance. The system converts the speech into images using the spectrogram feature, and CNN is used because it can extract features from images automatically. The study contributes to enhancing the classification process of Arabic speech dialects which is an essential issue as many of the studies working on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), while the majority of Arabs speak local dialects, it is necessary to identify the dialect used by speakers in order to communicate with one another or before machine translation takes place.","","978-1-6654-7275-3","10.1109/ICAISC56366.2023.10085647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10085647","Arabic Dialects;Convolutional Neural Networks;Dialect Identification;Automatic Dialect classification","Deep learning;Technological innovation;Smart cities;Speech enhancement;Feature extraction;Speech;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","8 Arab dialects;Arabic dialect features;Arabic dialects;Arabic speech dialect classification;Arabic speech dialects;dialect detection;local dialects;Modern Standard Arabic","","","","18","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main purpose of the research is to create a system that extracts both Sinhala and English Braille segments from a given Braille document and makes the Braille content into voice. At the beginning Embossed Sinhala or English Braille image which took from webcam or a high-resolution phone will use for image processing techniques such as gray scaling, thresholding, erosion, and dilation. Erosion and gray scaling help to eliminate the noise and the noise-free image used to detect contour. After pre-processing, the image using an OpenCV library do the segmentation and character extraction. Braille character recognition has done by taking binary to decimal equivalent numbers. Before generating voice output, recognized Braille letters should convert to corresponding language letters (either Sinhala letter or English) and mapping English letters can directly generate English words but in Sinhala need an additional step called Unicode Mapping to generate a Sinhala word. When a Braille document is in high quality, the system will reach for 95 percent accuracy level and generally, results have around 85.30 percent success rate. This software provides many usability characteristics to increase simplicity when it's using OpenCV and related technologies. Even teachers can use this to improve their teaching terminologies and explain things more clearly in their lessons.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313020","Braille letters;Image processing;OCR;Segmentation;Unicode mapping","Image processing;Libraries;Kernel;Image segmentation;Blindness;Thresholding (Imaging);Optical character recognition software","document image processing;feature extraction;handicapped aids;image segmentation;language translation;natural language processing;optical character recognition;speech processing","optical character recognition systems;OCR;English Braille characters;Braille codes;English Braille segments;English Braille image;high-resolution phone;image processing techniques;gray scaling;noise-free image;character extraction;Braille character recognition;voice output;Sinhala letter;English words;Sinhala word;machine translation system;English Braille documents;labor-intensive task;Braille letter;OpenCV;Webcam","","3","","10","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The result shows that the auto-generated subtitles in the original language (English) are fairly accurate already. By using them as the draft, human subtitle producers can save 54% of the working time and simultaneously reduce the error rate by 54.3%, which is a significant improvement.

The resulting system achieves word error rates below 10% on Arabic broadcasts. Very large scale experiments with unsupervised training demonstrate that the utility of unsupervised data depends on the amount of supervised data available. While unsupervised training improves system performance when a limited amount (135 h) of supervised data is available, these gains disappear when a greater amount (848 h) of supervised data is used, even with a very large (7069 h) corpus of unsupervised data. We also describe a method for modeling Arabic dialects that avoids the problem of data sparseness entailed by dialect-specific acoustic models via the use of non-phonetic, dialect questions in the decision trees. We show how this method can be used with a statically compiled decoding graph by partitioning the decision trees into a static component and a dynamic component, with the dynamic component being replaced by a mapping that is evaluated at run-time.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2022966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5075768","Dialect modeling;discriminative training;speech recognition;vowelization","Speech;Broadcasting;Decision trees;Training data;Vocabulary;Error analysis;Large-scale systems;System performance;Performance gain;Decoding","decision trees;natural language processing;speech processing;unsupervised learning","speech transcription;DARPA GALE program;dialect modelling;pronunciation variants;automatic vowelization;flat-start training;unsupervised training;decision trees;decoding graph","","22","3","23","IEEE","16 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they ignore the modeling and exploitation of fine-grained reasoning-related operations to support numerical reasoning, encountering the inadequacy in reasoning capability and interpretability. To alleviate this issue, we propose OPERA, an operation-augmented numerical reasoning framework. Concretely, we systematically define a scalable operation set to model numerical reasoning. We first identify reasoning-related operations based on context and then softly execute them to imitate the answer reasoning procedure via an operation-aware cross-attention mechanism. Finally, we utilize the operation-augmented semantic representation of execution results to support answer prediction. We verify the effectiveness and generalization of OPERA in two scenarios with different knowledge sources and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments on two textual datasets, DROP and RACENum, and a table-text hybrid dataset TAT-QA. Experiment results show that OPERA outperforms previous strong methods on the DROP, RACENum, and TAT-QA datasets.

The performance of it is further improved by our novel approach which provides a system that gives information about possible decompositions of the word inflected by many morphemes. Using these possible decompositions the root word could be extracted for those words which were unrecognized by rule based morphological analyzer.

In this present work we present an unsupervised stemmer for improving the performance of Telugu rule based morph analyzer.

Existing Tamil POS taggers are either not publicly available, inaccurate or use a non-standard POS tagset. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art, contextual neural POS tagger named ThamizhiPOSt. It tags words in a sentence with their lexical category, using the Universal Part of Speech tagset. Each tag is based on the word's context in the sentence. ThamizhiPOSt also integrates a tokeniser and a sentence segmenter so that it can handle raw Tamil text. This paper introduces this POS tagger and compares it with existing tools and resources for Tamil POS tagging. ThamizhiPOSt reports an accuracy of 93.27% for unseen data, which constitutes the best score in comparison to the publicly available Tamil POS taggers. ThamizhiPOSt and its associated resources are all made public. Further, ThamizhiPOSt has been published as a Python library for others to build upon.","","978-1-6654-8311-7","10.1109/IALP54817.2021.9675195","World Bank; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675195","POS tagging;Tamil language;contextual tagging;NLP","Buildings;Tagging;Libraries;Machine translation;Speech processing;Engines","natural language processing;text analysis;word processing","natural language processing systems;contextual neural POS tagger;ThamizhiPOSt;lexical category;sentence segmenter;raw Tamil text;Tamil POS tagging;part of speech tagger;Tamil Language;Tamil POS taggers;Universal Part of Speech tagset;Python library;tokeniser","","","","18","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The field of study called machine transliteration transforms words from one language to another while preserving their phonetic properties. With the rise of the Internet and the rapid expansion of online data, Information Retrieval (IR) has become a more significant field. Foreign terms are increasingly being incorporated into languages due to the development of new technologies and the flood of information available online. This generally indudes changing the adopted word's orthographical form as well as its original pronunciation to match the phonological norms of the target language. Transliteration describes this phonetic “translation” of a foreign language. Machine translation and cross-language information retrieval both benefit from transliteration. Ambiguity, variability, and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are a few of the crucial challenges that transliteration systems must deal with. This paper represents the transliteration models of the last decade used for transliteration-related research carried out by researchers.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10099632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099632","Transliteration;Transliteration models;Grapheme;Phoneme;Hybrid;Transliteration approaches","Training;Support vector machines;Hidden Markov models;Training data;Transforms;Phonetics;Information retrieval","information retrieval;Internet;language translation;natural language processing;speech processing","cross-language information retrieval;foreign language;foreign terms;globalization;language barriers;machine translation;machine transliteration;online data;OOV word;out-of-vocabulary word;phonetic properties;phonetic translation;target language;transliteration systems","","1","","43","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A lot of work has been done on POS tagging mainly for European and Asiatic languages, while in Africa, more work is needed mostly due to the lack of the annotated corpus. Some significant works have been done on African languages, such as Arabic, Igbo, Swahili and Yoruba, South African official languages. However, African languages are generally under-resourced, in particular, in terms of lexical semantics annotated corpora, necessary for effective NLP tools and applications. Hence, advances in this direction have been limited. The main aim of the work reported in this paper is the development of a POS tagger model for an under-resourced Setswana African language. A review of some POS taggers for different African languages is conducted, challenges and techniques used in creating the POS taggers are elicited, and a POS tagger model for Setswana language using SVMTool is presented.","","978-1-7281-0040-1","10.1109/IMITEC45504.2019.9015871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9015871","NLP;POS tagging;African languages;Annotated corpus;Machine learning","Tagging;Hidden Markov models;Tools;Machine learning;Data models;Support vector machines;Linguistics","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;support vector machines;text analysis","lexical semantics;Setswana African language;part of speech tagging;natural language processing;European languages;Asiatic languages;POS tagging;SVMTool;machine learning","","1","","22","IEEE","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, errors introduced in the MT process create a condition similar to the “mismatch” condition encountered in robust speech recognition. Such mismatch makes the performance of cross-lingual SLU far from acceptable. Motivated by successful solutions developed in robust speech recognition, we in this paper propose a multi-style adaptive training method to improve the robustness of the SLU system for cross-lingual SLU tasks. For evaluation, we created an English-Chinese bilingual ATIS database, and then carried out a series of experiments on that database to experimentally assess the proposed methods. Experimental results show that, without relying on any data in the second language, the proposed method significantly improves the performance on a cross-lingual SLU task while producing no degradation for input in the primary language. This greatly facilitates porting SLU to as many languages as there are MT systems without any human effort. We further study the robustness of this approach to another type of mismatch condition, caused by speech recognition errors, and demonstrate its success also.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-0356-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6639292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6639292","spoken language understanding;cross-lingual;adaptive training;multi-style training","Training;Training data;Robustness;Data models;Testing;Semantics;Degradation","decoding;language translation;natural language processing;speech recognition","cross-lingual spoken language understanding;machine translation services;MT services;second language;primary language;SLU system;semantic knowledge decoding;robust speech recognition;multistyle adaptive training method;cross-lingual SLU tasks;English-Chinese bilingual ATIS database","","7","1","30","IEEE","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the previous works in dense video captioning are solely based on visual information and completely ignore the audio track. However, audio, and speech, in particular, are vital cues for a human observer in understanding an environment. In this paper, we present a new dense video captioning approach that is able to utilize any number of modalities for event description. Specifically, we show how audio and speech modalities may improve a dense video captioning model. We apply automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to obtain a temporally aligned textual description of the speech (similar to subtitles) and treat it as a separate input alongside video frames and the corresponding audio track. We formulate the captioning task as a machine translation problem and utilize recently proposed Transformer architecture to convert multi-modal input data into textual descriptions. We demonstrate the performance of our model on ActivityNet Captions dataset. The ablation studies indicate a considerable contribution from audio and speech components suggesting that these modalities contain substantial complementary information to video frames.

However, in some application domains, it is difficult to apply machine learning methods to solve the new arising problems due to the lack of standardized and annotated datasets. People have to find their way from the very beginning of the data collecting, cleaning, and labeling. Unfortunately, there is not a guiding framework to deal with such a situation. This paper pays attention to it and proposes a general machine learning framework to solve the pratical problems from the scratch. It contains two main stages implemented by an unsupervised clustering method and a semi-supervised learning method representatively. In the first stage, an unsupervised clustering method is utilized to find representative data samples which are more important and can be used to do data cleaning and manual labeling. In the second stage, a semi-supervised method is adopted to predict the labels for the rest data samples and to construct a larger annotated dataset. A case study in the texture perception field has been done to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed application framework.","","978-1-6654-4368-5","10.1109/ICIVC52351.2021.9526959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526959","machine learning;application framework;unsupervised;semi-supervised;texture perception","Deep learning;Computer vision;Clustering methods;Computational modeling;Manuals;Speech recognition;Semisupervised learning","deep learning (artificial intelligence);image texture;pattern clustering;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","semisupervised learning method;unsupervised clustering method;annotated datasets;standardized datasets;deep learning;texture perception case study;machine learning framework","","","","16","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The only lexical information used in this work is a restricted form of bilingual dictionary (incomplete). The algorithm works based on the weighted sum of a set of statistical parameters and the parameter denoting degree of dictionary match. No other lexical information like part of speech tagging, chunking, n-gram statistics etc has been used in this work.

When the window size n is limited, the n-gram is weak in terms of capturing long distance dependencies. Long-distance Dependency information has long been proven useful in language model. However, the improved performance of long-distance LMs over conventional n-gram models generally comes at the cost of increased decoding complexity and model size. Word Activation Forces has been proven a simple and human-comparable accurate measure to identify word closest associates. In this paper, Word Activation Forces-Based language model is proposed to capture the long distance dependency between words, but which is as fast for decoding as a conventional word n-gram. As shown by experiments on broadcast news, the proposed language modeling and smoothing can significantly reduce the perplexity of language models and word error rate with moderate computational cost.","","978-0-7695-5011-4","10.1109/IHMSC.2013.140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6643952","long-distance dependency;language model;Word Activation Forces","Smoothing methods;Computational modeling;Training;Interpolation;Error analysis;Semantics;History","computational complexity;language translation;natural language processing;probability;smoothing methods;speech recognition;statistical analysis","word activation forces-based language modeling;word activation forces-based language smoothing;N-gram language models;word occurrence local dependencies;window size;long-distance dependency information;decoding complexity;model size;human-comparable accurate measure;word closest associate identification;perplexity reduction;word error rate;computational cost;automatic speech recognition","","1","","13","IEEE","24 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy.

Nowadays, the demand of POS tagging is increasing. POS tagging is an efficient method as preprocessing tagging, even meaningful in text to speech, syntactic analysis and machine translation. When it comes to the POS tagger, they need to know every word POS. It is available for human because it is easy for us to describe it. But when we increase the count of words to the million number, it is not possible to make people do POS tag. In this paper, we introduce Viterbi algorithm to help computer do the better job in tagging lexical categories. Viterbi algorithm is an algorithm that used dynamic programming to solve the POS of sentence. As we know, the word is sensitive about the position of the word. The POS of the word is related about the nearby words. We make simulations about how Viterbi Algorithms work in POS tagger and get the accuracy performance.","","978-1-5386-3573-5","10.1109/ICCSEC.2017.8446837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8446837","component;Viterbi;NLP;Possibility Distribution","Viterbi algorithm;Tagging;Fish;Dynamic programming;Hidden Markov models;Heuristic algorithms;Natural language processing","computational linguistics;dynamic programming;natural language processing","viterbi algorithm performance;part-of-speech tagger;natural language processing;POS tagging;machine translation;POS tagger;lexical categories;text to speech;dynamic programming","","1","","6","IEEE","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by the standard framework of statistical machine translation, we formulate a hierarchical generative model of a transcribed note sequence that consists of a music language model describing the pitch and onset transitions of a true note sequence and a transcription error model describing the addition of deletion, insertion, and substitution errors to the true sequence. Because the length of the true sequence might be different from that of the observed transcribed sequence, the most likely sequences with possible different lengths are estimated with Viterbi decoding and the most likely length is then selected with a sophisticated language model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.

To build automatic paraphrasing, a collection of paraphrased expressions is required. However, manually collecting paraphrases is expensive and time-consuming. Most existing paraphrases corpora cover only one-to-one parallel sentences and neglect the fact that possible variants of paraphrases can be generated from a single source sentence. The manipulation applied to the original sentences is also difficult to track. Furthermore, a single corpus is mostly dedicated to a single application that is not reusable in other applications. In this research, we construct a paraphrase corpus based on various elementary operations (reordering, substitution, deletion, insertion) in a crowdsourcing platform to generate multi- paraphrase sentences from a source sentence. These elementary paraphrase operations can be utilized for various applications (i.e., deletion for summarization and reordering for machine translation).

Experimental results that the complicated shapes like nonconvex boundaries can be recognized in high accuracy, even in the low-order model. It is seen that the complex PARCOR coefficients tend to provide more accurate classification than the complex AR coefficients.<>","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.126809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=126809","","Shape;Pattern recognition;Speech analysis;Predictive models;Signal analysis;Vectors;Sampling methods;Laboratories;Feature extraction;Computer vision","computer vision;filtering and prediction theory;statistics","computer vision;statistics;rotation invariance;scale invariance;translation invariance;shape recognition;complex autoregressive model;invariant feature extraction;complex autoregressive coefficients;complex PARCOR coefficients;nonconvex boundaries","","68","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A general simulation framework is introduced that supports discovery and proof of error bounds, which lead to the error bounds presented here. Initially derived tight lower and upper bounds for feature omission are generalized to feature selection, followed by another extension to context reduction of string class priors (aka language models) in string classification. For string classification, the quantitative effect of string class prior context reduction on symbol-level Bayes error is presented. The tightness of the original feature omission bounds seems lost in this case, as further simulations indicate. However, combining both feature omission and context reduction, the tightness of the bounds is retained. A central result of this work is the proof of the existence, and the amount of a statistical threshold w.r.t. the introduction of additional features in general pattern classification, or the increase of context in string classification beyond which a decrease in Bayes error is guaranteed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2788434","H2020 European Research Council(grant numbers:694537); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8242665","Error bound, Bayes error, feature selection, language model, perplexity, context reduction, pattern classification, sequence classification","Context modeling;Analytical models;Upper bound;Feature extraction;Measurement uncertainty;Automatic speech recognition","Bayes methods;feature extraction;language translation;pattern classification;statistical analysis","string classification;automatic speech recognition;string class prior context reduction;handwritten character recognition;simulation framework;Bayes error;pattern classification;feature omission bounds;lower tight error bounds;upper tight error bounds;statistical machine translation","","1","","22","IEEE","1 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aruvi is basically a chatbot that can mimic a virtual conversation with user (farmer) using regional language (Tamil). Aruvi is trained and made to learn on its own using ontology based mapping. Based on the user query it gives relevant answers, which is more useful for farmers in remote places. Using the proposed system, the user can know about the crops, their atmospheric conditions and suitable soil by querying the system in their own regional language to the chatbot. Another advantage of Aruvi, users can converse with it apart through menus or buttons via text or speech on websites or through mobile apps.

CLTE is challenging for transferring information between under resource (Amharic) language and high resource (English) language. To solve this problem, we have proposed Cross-lingual Textual Entailment model using deep neural network approaches. We have used Bi-LSTM to transfer sequential information, XLNet for handling a position of word and its boundary, MLP for classification and prediction outputs, and FastText to word representations. Neural machine translation is utilized for translating English sentences into Amharic sentences with IBM5 alignment. We have combined Amharic dataset with SNLI dataset and annotated based on multi-way classification. The NMT predicts 96.01% of the testing accuracy. We have obtained 89.92% training and 86.89% testing accuracy for the proposed model.

Speech analytics suffer from these translation errors. To tackle this difficulty, a solution consists in mapping translations into a space of hidden topics. In the classical topic-based representation obtained from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), distribution of words into each topic is estimated automatically. Nonetheless, the targeted classes are ignored in the particular context of a classification task. In the DSTC5 main task, this targeted class information is crucial, the main objective being to track dialog states for sub-dialog segments. For this challenge, we propose to apply an original topic-based representation for each sub-dialogue based not only on the sub-dialogue content itself (words), but also on the dialogue state related to the sub-dialogue. This original representation is based on the Author-Topic (AT) model, previously successfully applied on a different classification task. Promising results confirmed the interest of such a method, the AT model reaching performance slightly better in terms of F-measure than baseline ones given by the task's organizers.","","978-1-5090-4903-5","10.1109/SLT.2016.7846316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846316","Author-Topic Model;Dialog State Tracking;Sub-dialog Level","Speech;Resource management;Context;Registers;Support vector machines;Data collection;Protocols","interactive systems;speech processing;text analysis","dialog states;author-topic based representation;textual documents;translation errors;spoken dialogues;clean speech;speech analytics;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA","","1","","27","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is challenging to train the key refinement components of LevT due to training-inference discrepancy. By carefully designing experiments, our work reveals that the deletion module is under-trained while the insertion module is over-trained due to the imbalance training signals for the two refinement modules. Based on these observations, we further propose a dual learning approach that can remedy the imbalance training by feeding an initial input to both refinement modules, which is consistent with the process in inference. Experimental results on three representative NLP tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed approach. 1","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10094646","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10094646","Non-Autoregressive Model;Training Signal;Editing Operation;Machine Translation;Text Summarization;Grammar Error Correction","Training;Transformers;Acoustics;Error correction;Task analysis;Speech processing","","","","","","19","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous bitext parsing methods use human-annotated bilingual treebanks that are costly and troublesome to obtain. In the proposed method, we use an auto-generated bilingual treebank to train the parsing models. First, an SMT system is used to translate a monolingual treebank into the target language; then, a monolingual parser for the target language is used to parse the translated sentences. Since the auto-translated sentences and auto-parsed trees in the auto-generated bilingual treebank are far from perfect, the bilingual constraints are not sufficiently reliable. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to verify the reliability of the constraints using a large amount of target monolingual and bilingual unannotated data. Finally, we design a set of effective bilingual features for parsing models on the basis of the verified constraints. We conduct the experiments using a standard test data. The experimental results show that our bitext parser significantly outperforms monolingual parsers. Moreover, our method is still able to provide improvement when we use a larger monolingual treebank containing over 50 000 sentences. We also test the proposed method with different SMT systems and the results show that our method is very robust to the noise. In particular, the proposed method can be used in a purely monolingual setting with the help of SMT. That is, it does not need the human translation of the test set as previous methods do.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2180898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6111269","Dependency parsing;natural language processing;statistical machine translation;unannotated data","Humans;Reliability;Educational institutions;Data mining;Materials;Training;Noise","speech processing;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","bitext dependency parsing;autogenerated bilingual treebank;bilingual text dependency parsing;statistical machine translation systems;SMT systems;human-annotated bilingual treebanks;monolingual treebank;autotranslated sentences;autoparsed trees;bilingual constraints;bilingual unannotated data;bilingual features;bitext parser;monolingual parsers","","1","","37","IEEE","21 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hindi and English have Subject Object Verb (SOV) and Subject Verb Object (SVO) word orders, respectively. The basic requirement of parsers is to transform a SOV word order to a SVO word order and vice versa and Part of Speech (POS) tagging is essential for word grouping.

"Automatic Methods and Neural Networks in Arabic Texts Diacritization: A Comprehensive Survey","M. M. Almanea","College of Languages and Translation, Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","IEEE Access","5 Nov 2021","2021","9","","145012","145032","Arabic diacritics are signs used in Arabic orthography to represent essential morphophonological and syntactic information. It is a common practice to leave out those diacritics in written Arabic. Most Arabic electronic texts lack such diacritics. The processing of those texts for various purposes of Natural Language Processing is a complicated task. Diacritized words are necessary for applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech synthesis. To address this problem, several studies proposed automatic systems to restore diacritics in Arabic texts. The present paper presents an in-depth survey of 56 most recent Arabic diacritization studies. Based on the diacritization approach, the studies are grouped into four sections in terms of method; rule-based, simple statistical, hybrid, and Neural Networks. While rule-based methods such as morphological analyzers and lexicon retrievals were the earliest approaches, results indicated that they are still valuable tools that can aid in the process of diacritization. Effective statistical methods that produced diacritics with acceptable accuracy include Hidden Markov Model, n-grams, and Support Vector Machines. They are often accompanied by either rule-based or neural networks in hybrid systems. Neural networks, specifically Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory, reached very high diacritization accuracy levels. Studies employing neural networks focused on evaluating and comparing the efficacy of several types of neural networks or a hybrid of them, testing alternatives of input units or suggested schemes for partial daicritization. The study synthesizes the results of the studies, identifies research gaps, and offers recommendations for future research.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9585619","Arabic text diacritization;neural networks;Arabic corpora;deep learning;Arabic natural language processing","Syntactics;Linguistics;Artificial neural networks;Writing;Statistical analysis;Machine translation","computational linguistics;hidden Markov models;knowledge based systems;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;statistical analysis;support vector machines;text analysis","Arabic diacritics;Arabic electronic texts;Arabic orthography;Arabic texts diacritization;bidirectional long short term memory;hidden Markov model;n-grams;natural language processing;neural networks;rule-based method;statistical method;support vector machines;word diacritization","","4","","77","CCBY","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the proposed method extracts entities on Hindi Fraud Call (publicly not available) annotated Corpus using XLM-Roberta (base-sized model). By pre-training model to build the accurate NER system for datasets, the Authors are using XLM-Roberta as a multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder for learning deep bidirectional Hindi word representations. The fine-tuning concept is used in this proposed method. XLM-Roberta Model has been fine-tuned to extract nine entities from sentences based on context of sentences to achieve better performance.

Sentences in sounding language often describe complex situations, including some simple situations (for example, a few actions). The unit, which is processed about, is a proposal for a full participle. As a result of comparison of syntactic constructions is obtained a set of simple sentences in which all participles replace verb. A corresponding library to determine the syntax construction is developed. A new method for constructing a semantic unit of the computer system of sign language is proposed. The result of semantic analysis system is a list of correspondence “word-gesture”. Among the many alternatives of words based on semantic analysis algorithm, every word is assigned a unique lexical meaning. For simple sentences algorithms of semantic analysis are designed and implemented. The most priority directions of modification module semantic analysis may include the following: broadening the base of gesture, the implementation of parsing complex sentences, taking into account specifics of the Russian-language.","","978-1-5090-4069-8","10.1109/APEIE.2016.7806402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806402","Machine interpreter system;syntax construction;semantic analyses;sign language;Russian language","Semantics;Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Syntactics;Proposals;Dictionaries;Speech recognition","gesture recognition;grammars;sign language recognition","Russian sign language machine interpreter system;semantic construction;ViSiCAST project;Zardoz system;ASL Workbench;TEAM system;syntactic constructions;sounding language;syntax construction;word-gesture;semantic analysis algorithm;modification module semantic analysis;complex sentence parsing","","1","","10","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Noisy text is characterized by unusual forms such as abbreviations, phonetic translations, short forms etc. This led to the emergence of text normalization. Cleaning the noisy text has become an important factor for adequate development and deployment of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services such as text-to-speech and automatic translation. In this paper we introduce a channel based normalization model for cleaning the noisy texts. The normalization is based on the types of distortion such as grapheme distortion, abbreviation and phoneme distortion. The model will explore the type of distortion occurred in the noisy word and replace it by using the different channel list. Precursory evaluation shows that the channel model will normalize the noisy word to their standard peer with 96.43 % accuracy.","","978-1-4799-3759-2","10.1109/I2CT.2014.7092164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092164","Natural Language Processing;Machine Translation;Social Media;Text Normalization;Noisy words","Noise measurement;Hidden Markov models;Databases;Natural language processing;Standards;Computational modeling;Adaptation models","natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","noisy SMS text normalization model;digital media;social networks;chat rooms;forums;information sharing;noisy text;text normalization;natural language processing services;text-to-speech;automatic translation;grapheme distortion;phoneme distortion;noisy word;channel model","","1","","16","IEEE","23 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to dig the concealed phonotactic structure out of the phone-likelihood vectors through a kind of multivariate time series analysis: dynamic linear models (DLM). In these models, treating the generation of phone patterns in each utterance as a dynamic system, the relationship between adjacent vectors is linearly and time-invariantly modeled, and unobserved states are introduced to capture a temporal coherence intrinsic in the system. Each utterance expressed by the DLM is further transformed into a fixed-dimensional linear subspace so that well-developed distance measures between two subspaces can be applied to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in a dissimilarity-based fashion. The results of SLR experiments on the OGI-TS corpus demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the well-known vector space modeling (VSM)-based methods and achieves comparable performance to our previous subspace-based method.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-0356-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6638993","phonotactic language recognition","Vectors;Speech;Support vector machine classification;Decoding;Speech recognition;Acoustics;Computational modeling","language translation;speaker recognition;time series","subspace-based method;VSM-based methods;vector space modeling;dissimilarity-based fashion;linear discriminant analysis;fixed-dimensional linear subspace;phone patterns generation;multivariate time series analysis;dynamic linear models;phone-likelihood vectors;phonotactic structure;phone recognizers;spoken language recognition;phone patterns;multivariate dynamic linear models;subspace-based phonotactic language recognition","","2","","30","IEEE","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, CNHG is a zero-shot scenario. To solve this problem, we propose zero resource CNHG with reinforcement learning. We develop a reinforcement learning framework that is composed of two modules: a neural machine translation (NMT) module and a CNHG module. The translation module translates an input document into a source language document, and the headline generation module takes the previous output as input to generate a target language headline.

We use N-gram Model which is used in many purposes like machine translation, speech recognition, to extract syntactic information etc. We have used a combination of Bi-gram and Tri-gram with candidate word which is going to be detected whether it is a real-word error or not. We have developed corpora which contain: (i) one of them is a collection of sets of homophone (confusing) word, (ii) another two are the collection of bigrams and trigrams using homophone word and (iii) other seven are the test sets. A candidate word extracts the set of homophone words from the corpus. In our proposed method, we create tri-gram and bigram using homophone word, then it checks the validity and takes the frequency of bi-gram or tri-gram, and finally calculates the probability for making the final decision about the candidate word. We have used around a million words to inspect our system. Our proposed method achieves more than 96% accuracy in detecting and correcting real-word errors of Bangla Text.","","978-1-5386-8207-4","10.1109/ICBSLP.2018.8554502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554502","Bangla homophones;NLP;Real-word error;N-gram;Markov model","Feature extraction;Computer science;Asia;Probability;Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Tagging","error correction;natural language processing;probability;spelling aids;text analysis","candidate word;million words;homophone error;homophone word;bigram;Bangla language;n-gram model;real-world error detection;real-word errors correction;spelling error;machine translation;speech recognition;syntactic information;trigram;probability;Bangla text","","4","","9","IEEE","2 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past, to convert raw data into valuable information, machine learning techniques were extensively preferred. However, conventional techniques such as Naive Bayes and support vector machines are not efficient for these huge data. Therefore, deep learning methods which are especially preferred in image/speech recognition, information retrieval, language translation, etc., arise as sophisticated and acceptable choices to process data with high accuracy in a hierarchical representation model. Depending on the size of data, even deep learning techniques can be inadequate. To increase the performance, some parallel processing techniques are needed which can be executed on a multi-core structure of the processor. With the technological improvements, the Graphical Processing Units(GPUs), which can contain a few thousands of cores, can also be used in this parallel execution platform. In this paper, we aimed to use a deep learning approach for processing big data to solve a specific problem in a multi-core platform. The experimental results are compared with a CPU execution, and it is depicted that use of GPU Technologies increases the performance of system up to 10 times depending on the type of the GPUs.","","978-1-5386-5135-3","10.1109/EBBT.2018.8391429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8391429","deep learning;big data;parallel programming;machine learning","Machine learning;Neurons;Graphics processing units;Big Data;Machine learning algorithms;Biological neural networks;Computer architecture","Big Data;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;parallel processing","deep learning methods;image/speech recognition;information retrieval;language translation;hierarchical representation model;parallel processing techniques;multicore structure;parallel execution platform;Graphical Processing Units;support vector machines;machine learning techniques;big data","","13","","14","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The development of human-machine interaction leads to a more natural interaction. In daily interactions, human uses speech, more dominant than the other way such as gestures and eye contact. Speech is the vocalized form of human communication which is closely related to language system. The problem is meaning, ambiguity, and the language that is not according to the rules of syntax, causing the command translation become more complex. To understand the meaning of the voice command, it is necessary to know the semantic and syntactic structure of sentences. An artificial intelligence technology that can understand Indonesian voice commands for robotic applications will be developed in this research. The purpose of this research is to translate voice command into the robots action, to generate human-machine interaction more natural. The voice command will be extracted using bark-frequency cepstral coefficients. Cepstral identified into words using neural networks. Words in a complete sentences will be processed using natural language processing so that, the meaning and appropriate action from the given command can be executed.

Discourse level analysis involves various sub-problems that deal with relationships between sentences and larger linguistic units. One such phenomenon is Anaphora Resolution (AR). Anaphora occurs frequently in written texts and spoken languages. Anaphora resolution is required in almost every application of NLP as information extraction (IE), summarization and Machine translation. The main focus of this paper is Entity Resolution (ER) and pronominal forms. Various approaches have been discussed to resolve Entity-pronoun references in Hindi.

Identification of a non-native speaker is often readily apparent in normal conversation with a native speaker through speech content and accent. Such identification which requires familiarity with language nuances may not be possible for a non-native interrogator or intelligence analyst or when conversing or listening through a machine language translator. Developing an automatic system to identify speakers as native or non-native, as well as their native language, including dialect, within input audio streams, is the major goal of this project. Such a system may be used alone or with other downstream applications such as machine language translation systems. In this paper we present four approaches to identify native and non-native speakers as a binary recognition problem. The approaches can be further categorized into phonetic-based approaches and non-phonetic-based approaches. These approaches were tested on two separate databases, including text-dependent read speech and text-independent spontaneous speech. The results show that our system is competitive in comparison with other published, state-of-the-art non-native speaker recognition systems. Key metrics for automated non-native recognition systems include: 1) positive identification rates, 2) false alarm/identification rates, and 3) length of captured speech sample required to reach a decision.","","978-1-4244-6048-9","10.1109/THS.2010.5655088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655088","non-native;accent recognition;speaker recognition;Hidden Markov Model;Gaussian Mixture Model;neural network;discriminative training;fusion","Hidden Markov models;Databases;Training;Speaker recognition;Speech;Artificial neural networks;Classification algorithms","language translation;natural language processing;speaker recognition","nonnative speaker recognition system;nonnative personnel identification;machine language translator;binary recognition problem;phonetic-based approach;text-dependent read speech;text-independent spontaneous speech","","3","","18","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we point out that deep learning automatically induces group sparsity of weights, in which all weights connected to an output channel (node) are zero, when training DNNs under the following three conditions: (1) rectified-linear-unit (ReLU) activations, (2) an L2-regularized objective function, and (3) the Adam optimizer. Next, we analyze this behavior both theoretically and experimentally, and propose a simple model reduction method: eliminate the zero weights after training the DNN. In experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate the sparsity with various training setups.

The system recognizes dialect utterances on the basis of the statistical simulation of vocabulary transformation and combinations of several dialect models. Previous dialect ASR systems were based on handcrafted dictionaries for several dialects, which involved costly processes. The proposed system statistically trains transformation rules between a common language and dialects, and simulates a dialect corpus for ASR on the basis of a machine translation technique. The rules are trained with small sets of parallel corpora to make up for the lack of linguistic resources on dialects. The proposed system also accepts mixed dialect utterances that contain a variety of vocabularies. In fact, spoken language is not a single dialect but a mixed dialect that is affected by the circumstances of speakers’ backgrounds (e.g., native dialects of their parents or where they live). We addressed two methods to combine several dialects appropriately for each speaker. The first was recognition with language models of mixed dialects with automatically estimated weights that maximized the recognition likelihood. This method performed the best, but calculation was very expensive because it conducted grid searches of combinations of dialect mixing proportions that maximized the recognition likelihood. The second was integration of results of recognition from each single dialect language model. The improvements with this model were slightly smaller than those with the first method. Its calculation cost was, however, inexpensive and it worked in real-time on general workstations. Both methods achieved higher recognition accuracies for all speakers than those with the single dialect models and the common language model, and we could choose a suitable model for use in ASR that took into consideration the computational costs and recognition accuracies.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2387414","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001195","Corpus simulation;mixture of dialects;speech recognition","Speech;Hidden Markov models;Accuracy;Acoustics;Vocabulary;Pragmatics;Computational modeling","","","","6","","27","IEEE","5 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The experimental results show that existing state-of-the-art parsers reach new heights of performance on the main benchmarks for dependency parsing and semantic role labeling with this memory network.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2020.3030500","National Key Research, and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0304100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836222,61733011); JSPS Grant-in-Aid(grant numbers:19K20354); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222278","Memory network;semantic role labeling;syntactic dependency parsing","Semantics;Syntactics;Linguistics;Labeling;Random access memory;Task analysis;Speech processing","computational linguistics;grammars;learning (artificial intelligence)","state-of-the-art parsers;linguistic structure parser;memory component;performance improvement bottleneck;machine learning terminology;lazy learning method;memory-based learning;linguistic structure parsing;memory network;semantic role labeling;dependency parsing","","5","","74","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Peer review is the impartial evaluation of your research article by subject matter experts in your area. Its objective is to assess the manuscript's quality and publishing readiness. This paper will be considering these peer reviews and use computational linguistics to relate them with acceptance of the manuscript. This paper will focus on text conversions in depth and discuss the flow of natural language processing. Natural language processing is a field of computer science and artificial intelligence that studies how computers interact with human languages, In specific it is an automated process of analyzing human language in order to gain information from it. Automation is the ultimate goal for efficiency driven organisations and Natural language processing is playing an important role in it. A machine can fully understand humans only when it communicates it with human language, its like communicating to someone who speaks your native language versus someone who speaks language you hardly can speak or understand. Natural language processing removes this gap. Text processing and text summarization, Automatic translation of languages, user interfaces, speech recognition and expert systems are examples of natural language processing applications. Chal-lenges for processing the complex language system of humans are far too many as human emotions and expressions through voice and body language are not fully decode in data. In near future everyone will have to communicate with a machine for household work as well as space work, so it becomes important to understand the working of Artificial Intelligence and Natural language processing is an important part of it.","","978-1-6654-6855-8","10.1109/GCAT55367.2022.9971874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9971874","Natural language Processing (NLP);Machine learning;Stemming;Lemmetization;TF-IDF;Artificial Intelligence(AI);Bag of words;Vectorizer","Automation;Text analysis;Publishing;Machine learning;User interfaces;Natural language processing;Task analysis","computational linguistics;expert systems;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;speech recognition;text analysis;user interfaces","artificial intelligence;computational linguistics;human language;natural language processing applications;peer review;speech recognition;text conversions;text processing;text summarization;user interfaces","","","","22","IEEE","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, the successful impact of LMs promote to introduce efficient techniques as well as different types models in various linguistic applications. The LMs mainly include two types that are grammars and statistical language models that is also called N-grams. The main difference between grammars and statistical language models is that the statistical language models are based on the estimation of probabilities for words sequences while the grammars usually do not have probabilities. Despite there are many toolkits that are used to create LMs, however, this work employs two well-known language modeling toolkits with focus on the Arabic text. The implementing toolkits include the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)-Cambridge Language Modeling Toolkit and the Cambridge University Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) language modeling toolkits. For clarification, we used a small Arabic text corpus to compute the N-grams for 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram. In addition, this paper demonstrates the intermediate steps that are needed to generate the ARPA-format LMs using both toolkits.","","978-1-5386-0872-2","10.1109/ICECTA.2017.8251935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251935","Arabic;language model;grammar;N-grams;perplexity","Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Grammar;Probability;Vocabulary;Speech recognition;Pragmatics","computational linguistics;grammars;hidden Markov models;natural language processing;text analysis","natural language processing;machine translation;grammars;Arabic text;Carnegie Mellon University-Cambridge Language Modeling Toolkit;Cambridge University Hidden Markov Model Toolkit language modeling toolkits;statistical N-grams language models;automatic speech recognition;words sequences","","","","17","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classification of hate speech multilabel text is investigated using RFDT, BiLSTM, and BiLSTM with the pre-trained BERT model. The Classifier Chains, Label Powerset, and Binary Relevance methods are also used as data transformation, and TF-IDF is also used as feature extraction combined with the RFDT classification method. Some scenarios of the preprocessing stage are also carried out to find the best results, namely full preprocess, without stopword removal, and without stemming and without stopword removal. The problem of having Indonesian, English, and a mixture of both is solved in two ways, namely, without being translated and translated into Indonesian. The best results with an accuracy of 76.12% were obtained using the RFDT classification method with Classifier Chains, without translation, without stemming, and without stopword removal.

In this paper, we improve the self-attention networks by better integrating sequential relations, which is essential for modeling natural languages. Specifically, we 1) propose a position-based attention to model the interaction between two words regarding positions; 2) perform separated attention for the context before and after the current position, respectively; and 3) merge the above two parts with a position-aware gated fusion mechanism. Experiments in natural language inference, machine translation and sentiment analysis tasks show that our sequential relation modeling helps self-attention networks outperform existing approaches.

In this paper we select four popular word embedding models (Word2Vec CBOW and Skip-Gram; FastText and GloVe) and train them on the 10 million token isiZulu National Corpus (INC) to create isiZulu word embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that word embeddings in isiZulu have been constructed and made available to the public. We create a semantic similarity data set analogous to WordSim353, which we also make publicly available. This data set is used to conduct an evaluation of the four models to determine which is the best for creating isiZulu word embeddings in a low-resource (small corpus) setting. We found that the Word2Vec Skip-Gram model produced the highest quality embeddings, as measured by this semantic similarity task.

Such offensive contents are responsible for depression and suicidal-related activities. Since online social networking is increasing day by day, the hate content is also increasing. Several investigations have been done on the domain of cyberbullying, cyberaggression, hate speech, etc. The majority of the inquiry has been done in the English language. Some languages (Hindi and Bangla) still lack proper investigations due to the lack of a dataset. This paper particularly worked on the Hindi, Bangla, and English datasets to detect aggressive comments and have shown a novel way of generating machine-translated data to resolve data unavailability issues. A fully machine-translated English dataset has been analyzed with the models such as the Long Short term memory model (LSTM), Bidirectional Long-short term memory model (BiLSTM), LSTM-Autoencoder, word2vec, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT-2) to make an observation on how the models perform on a machine-translated noisy dataset. We have compared the performance of using the noisy data with two more datasets such as raw data, which does not contain any noises, and semi-noisy data, which contains a certain amount of noisy data. We have classified both the raw and semi-noisy data using the aforementioned models. To evaluate the performance of the models, we have used evaluation metrics such as F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall. We have achieved the highest accuracy on raw data using the gpt2 model, semi-noisy data using the BERT model, and fully machine-translated data using the BERT model. Since many languages do not have proper data availability, our approach will help researchers create machine-translated datasets for several analysis purposes.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020249","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020249","Cyber-bullying;Augmentation;Data preprocessing;AutoEncoder;LSTM;BiLSTM;Word2vec;BERT;GPT-2","Deep learning;Training;Analytical models;Bit error rate;Organizations;Big Data;Transformers","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;social networking (online)","aforementioned models;aggressive comments;BERT model;Bidirectional Long-short term memory model;data unavailability issues;English language;fully machine-translated English dataset;generative pre-trained transformer;gpt2 model;hate content;lack proper investigations;languages;Long Short term memory model;machine translated data vs real life data;machine-translated data;machine-translated datasets;machine-translated noisy dataset;noisy data;offensive contents;online social networking;proper data availability;raw data;seminoisy data;social media negatively impact human life;suicidal-related activities","","4","","42","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) converts spoken audio streams to plain texts, but a follow-up Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-system is needed to understand the contextual meaning from the text and act. For the specific human-vehicle navigation dialogue application, the two major tasks include (1) intent detection - decide whether a sentence is navigation-related, and (2) semantic parsing - retrieve important information (e.g., point-of-interest destinations) from the words. To address these two tasks, this study proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, with the consideration of (1) one joint model vs. two separate models, (2) a context window approach vs. sequence-to-sequence translation approach, as well as (3) alternate model hyper-parameter selections. The experiment is conducted with both the benchmark ATIS dataset and the CU-Move in-vehicle dialogue corpus, and the result is compared against related state-of-the-art methods. Overall, the proposed solution on the CU-Move data achieves accuracies of 98.24% for intent detection and 99.60% for semantic parsing, outperforming other related methods.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317620","","Task analysis;Navigation;Semantics;Recurrent neural networks;Logic gates;Computer architecture","audio streaming;information retrieval;interactive systems;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speech processing;speech recognition;speech-based user interfaces;text analysis;traffic engineering computing","infotainment applications;Automatic Speech Recognition;audio streams;plain texts;contextual meaning;specific human-vehicle navigation dialogue application;point-of-interest destinations;Recurrent Neural Network architecture;intelligent vehicles;semantic parsing;navigation dialogue language processing;voice-based human-machine interface;Natural Language Processing subsystem;intent detection;one joint model-vs.-two separate models;context window approach-vs.-sequence-to-sequence translation approach;alternate model hyperparameter selections;ATIS dataset;CU-Move in-vehicle dialogue corpus","","5","","31","IEEE","15 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LM plays a key role in many important natural language applications such as speech recognition and machine translation. Scaling up LM is important since it is widely accepted by the community that there is no data like more data. Eventually, we would like to train on terabytes (TBs) of text (trillions of words). Modern training methods are far from this goal, because of various bottlenecks, especially memory (within GPUs) and communication (across GPUs). This paper shows how Zipf's Law can address these bottlenecks by grouping parameters for common words and character sequences, because U ≪ N, where U is the number of unique words (types) and N is the size of the training set (tokens). For a local batch size K with G GPUs and a D-dimension embedding matrix, we reduce the original per-GPU memory and communication asymptotic complexity from Θ(GKD) to Θ(GK + UD). Empirically, we find U ∝ (GK)^0.64 on four publicly available large datasets. When we scale up the number of GPUs to 64, a factor of 8, training time speeds up by factors up to 6.7× (for character LMs) and 6.3× (for word LMs) with negligible loss of accuracy. Our weak scaling on 192 GPUs on the Tieba dataset shows a 35% improvement in LM prediction accuracy by training on 93 GB of data (2.5× larger than publicly available SOTA dataset), but taking only 1.25× increase in training time, compared to 3 GB of the same dataset running on 6 GPUs.","1530-2075","978-1-7281-1246-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820976","Language Modeling;Deep Learning;High Performance Computing;Communication Optimization","Training;Vocabulary;Graphics processing units;Computational modeling;Data models;Neural networks;Natural languages","graphics processing units;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;speech recognition;text analysis","common words;unique words;training set;training time;weak scaling;LM prediction accuracy;language modeling;training data;important natural language applications;speech recognition;machine translation;modern training methods;Zipf law;GPU;word LM","","","","44","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They achieve translation invariance by spatial convolution and pooling mechanisms, while their ability in scale invariance is limited. To tackle the problem of scale variation in image classification, this work proposed a multi-scale CNN model with depth-decreasing multi-column structure. Input images were decomposed into multiple scales and at each scale image, a CNN column was instantiated with its depth decreasing from fine to coarse scale for model simplification. Scale-invariant features were learned by weights shared across all scales and pooled among adjacent scales. Particularly, a coarse-to-fine pre-training method imitating the human's development of spatial frequency perception was proposed to train this multi-scale CNN, which accelerated the training process and reduced the classification error. In addition, model averaging technique was used to combine models obtained during pre-training and further improve the performance. With these methods, our model achieved classification errors of 15.38% on CIFAR-10 dataset and 41.29% on CIFAR-100 dataset, i.e. 1.05% and 2.97% reduction compared with single-scale CNN model.","2161-4407","978-1-4799-1960-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280542","","Training;Laplace equations;Airplanes;Automobiles;Birds;Atmospheric modeling;Marine vehicles","feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","coarse-to-fine trained multiscale convolutional neural networks;image classification;feature learning;translation invariance;spatial convolution mechanism;pooling mechanism;scale variation problem;multiscale CNN training;depth-decreasing multicolumn structure;input images;scale-invariant feature learning;spatial frequency perception;classification error reduction;model averaging technique;performance improvement;CIFAR-IO dataset;CIFAR-100 dataset","","2","4","32","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose three deep learning models to recover Arabic text diacritics based on our work in a text-to-speech synthesis system using deep learning. The first model is a baseline model used to test how a simple deep learning model performs on the corpora. The second model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, which resembles our text-to-speech synthesis model with many modifications to suit this problem. The last model is based on the encoder part of the text-to-speech model, which achieves state-of-the-art performances in both word error rate and diacritic error rate metrics.

WSD is widely used in text classification, machine translation and information retrieval and so on. WSD accuracy is low because disambiguation features can not cover more language phenomenon and the discriminative ability of WSD model is not high. In order to improve accuracy of simplified Chinese WSD, a WSD model based on multi-head self-attention and gated-dilated convolutional neural network(AGDCNN) is proposed. Ambiguous word is viewed as the center and 4 adjacent lexical units are extracted successively toward the left and right side. Words, parts of speech, and semantic categories in 4 adjacent lexical units are vectorized and the vectorized results are input into gated-dilated convolutional neural network to get discriminative features. Then, multi-head self-attention is adopted to learn the difference and connection among discriminative features fully. Finally, classification weights are output from adaptive average pooling layer. Experiments are conducted on SemEval-2007: Task#5 and SemEval-2021: Task#2. Experimental results show that AGDCNN model has higher accuracy compared with other methods. Our goal is to improve the quality of simplified Chinese WSD as much as possible based on current linguistic resources and machine learning methods. The challenge we face is to extract effective discriminative features and design disambiguation model in high quality. Our novelty lies in that gated-dilated convolution is combined with multi-head self-attention to extract effective discriminative features, and learn their difference and connection from word form, parts of speech, and semantic categories.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3243574","Heilongjiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LH2022F031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041152","Word sense disambiguation;multi-head self-attention;convolutional neural network;part of speech;semantic category","Text analysis;Feature extraction;Semantics;Adaptation models;Task analysis;Logic gates;Convolutional neural networks;Speech recognition","computational linguistics;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;information retrieval;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);linguistics;natural language processing;pattern classification;sentiment analysis;text analysis;word processing","4 adjacent lexical units;AGDCNN model;ambiguous word;correct sense;current linguistic resources;design disambiguation model;disambiguation features;discriminative ability;effective discriminative features;gated-dilated convolution;gated-dilated convolutional neural network;machine learning methods;multihead self-attention;semantic categories;simplified Chinese WSD;word form;word sense disambiguation;WSD accuracy;WSD model","","1","","32","CCBY","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The difference between a digitized handwritten document and a scanned document is that the prior one can be edited, and the latter cannot. Significant developments have been made on the handwritten character recognition of widely used languages like English. India is a multilingual country where there exist multiple regional languages like Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam and other Dravidian Languages with complex scripts. Kannada is spoken in most of the regions of Karnataka State, which is one of the southern regions of India. In the proposed research, a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is practiced to recognize Kannada handwritten Characters. The research employs densely connected-convolutional networks or DenseNet variant of CNN to recognize handwritten Kannada characters. DenseNet is preferred in this research for its known advantages such as enhanced feature propagation, improved feature reuse, and minimized vanishing gradient problem. The dataset used in the experimentation is a standard Char74k dataset. The prime objective of this research is to devise a machine learning based application to recognize Kannada handwritten characters with high accuracy and convert them into digitized characters. Digitized documents promote the growth of several other major applications like speech conversion, language translation and conversion of medieval documents. A testing accuracy of 93.87% is observed for 3285 images of handwritten Kannada characters with 5 images from each of the 657 classes. This machine learning model can also be trained to recognize characters of different Indian languages.","","979-8-3503-2379-5","10.1109/ICAISC58445.2023.10199168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10199168","Handwritten Character Recognition;Kannada;Convolution Neural Network;DenseNet;Machine Learning","Handwriting recognition;Symbols;Machine learning;Character recognition;Convolutional neural networks;Standards;Testing","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);document image processing;feature extraction;handwritten character recognition;image classification;natural language processing;text detection","CNN;convolutional neural network;densely connected-convolutional networks;DenseNet variant;digitized characters;digitized handwritten document;Dravidian languages;handwritten text;Indian languages;Kannada handwritten character recognition system;language translation;machine learning approach;minimized vanishing gradient problem;multiple regional languages;standard Char74k dataset","","","","19","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electrooculogram (EOG) – a natural bio-electric signal generated during eye movements, if decoded, is of great potential to reveal the user’s mind and enable voice-free communication for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS patients usually lose physical movement abilities including speech and handwriting but fortunately can move their eyes. In this study, we propose a novel deep transfer learning-empowered system, called ""eyeSay"", which leverages both deep learning and transfer learning for intelligent eye EOG-to-speech translation. More specifically, we have designed a multi-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the eye-written words, named as CNN-word. Moreover, to reveal fundamental patterns of eye movements, we build a transferable feature extractor, CNN-stroke, upon eye strokes that are building components of an eye word. Then, we transfer the CNN-stroke model to the eye word learning task in an innovative way, that is, use CNN-stroke as an additional branch of CNN-word to generate a stroke probability map. The achieved boostCNN-word model, enhanced by the transferable feature extractor, has greatly improved the eye word decoding performance. This novel study will directly contribute to voice-free communications for ALS patients, and greatly advance the ubiquitous eye EOG-based smart health area.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629874","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629874","Smart Health;Deep Learning;Transfer Learning;Electrooculography;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Solid modeling;Wheelchairs;Smart healthcare;Transfer learning;Virtual reality;Speech recognition;Feature extraction","brain;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;electro-oculography;eye;feature extraction;handicapped aids;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing","eyeSay;ALS patients;eye dynamics;brain activities;smart health applications;natural bio-electric signal;eye movements;voice-free communication;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;physical movement abilities including speech;deep transfer learning-empowered system;deep learning;intelligent eye EOG-to-speech translation;multistage convolutional neural network;eye-written words;CNN-word;transferable feature extractor;eye strokes;CNN-stroke model;eye word learning task;stroke probability map;eye word decoding performance;ubiquitous eye EOG-based smart health area;boostCNN-word model;deep transfer learning-empowered wearable","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Electrooculography;Eye Movements;Humans;Machine Learning;Wearable Electronic Devices","4","","17","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Auditory information plays an important role in information location, this comes from the fact that it can be difficult to find useful information. Thus audio classification becomes more important in audio analysis as it prepares for content-based audio retrieval. There is quite a bit of research on the topic of audio classification methods, audio feature analysis, and extraction based on audio classification. Many works of literature extract features of audio signals based on time or Fourier transform frequency domain. The emergence of the wavelet theory provides a time-frequency analysis tool for signal analysis. Wavelet transformation is a local transformation of the signal in time and frequency which can effectively extract information from the signal, and perform multi-scale refinement analysis on functions or signals through operations such as stretching and translation instead of the traditional Fourier transformation. In the time-frequency analysis of the signal, the wavelet analysis captures the local time and frequency characters of the signal which can improve the ability of signal analysis. It can also change certain locals of the signal without affecting other aspects of it. In this paper, the frequency domain features are combined with the wavelet domain features.

However, conventional RNNs suffered from vanishing and exploding gradients, resulting in poor network performance in applications with long-term input information. As a variant of RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) had been proposed to tackle this issue. Nevertheless, at the same time, LSTM introduces gating units and many additional parameters, which makes it challenging to be implemented directly on resource-limited platforms, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This work first investigated the overall maximum achievable compression rates of different gating units and their correlations. Then, Gating Units Level Balanced Compression (GBC) strategy is proposed. After Top- $k$  pruning, the proposed GBC strategy can attain a compression rate of  $36.6\times $  for LSTM. Further, the theoretical analysis indicates that for the existing gating units level LSTM compression variants, the GBC strategy still has further potential for compression. A complementary compression of the GBC strategy is performed on the existing coupled-gate LSTM to verify the analysis. Experimental results show that GBC achieves an additional  $32\times $  (overall  $42.7\times $ ) compression rate with negligible accuracy loss. Finally, hardware experiments conducted on Xilinx ADM-PCIE-7V3 FPGAs also demonstrate that the accelerator designed in this paper achieves an improvement of 7.4%-191.5% in energy efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2022.3181975","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20210286); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61704005,62022041); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NP2022103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803872","RNN;LSTM;neural network compression;FPGAs","Field programmable gate arrays;Recurrent neural networks;Logic gates;Correlation;Compression algorithms;Task analysis;Machine translation","data compression;field programmable gate arrays;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","energy-efficient LSTM accelerator;recurrent neural networks;automatic speech recognition;long-term input information;long short-term memory;field programmable gate arrays;compression rates;gating units;GBC strategy;compression rate;LSTM compression variants;complementary compression;energy efficiency;gating unit level balanced compression strategy;coupled-gate LSTM;top-k pruning;GBC;Xilinx ADM-PCIE-7V3 FPGA","","3","","36","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multi-level annotation performed is Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which includes the detailed information, such as surface form, dictionary form, pronunciation, difficulty level and etc. The well-trained model is applied to automatic identification and suggestion of the Japanese sentence patterns with different difficulty levels according to Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). We evaluated the model on a test dataset in order to show the effectiveness of our proposed methods. We also show how we used this model to construct a Japanese-Chinese bilingual corpus, and manually corrected the example sentences where the Japanese sentence patterns were identified incorrectly or not identified. This model can be effectively used for the Japanese language processing framework, which allows for a fast and easy application for the problem of Japanese grammar extraction.

This not only produces tremendous speed advantages, but also provides a powerful language for specifying what generalizations the network can perform.<>","","0-8186-2915-0","10.1109/ICPR.1992.201861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=201861","","Digital images;Machine learning;Training data;Machine learning algorithms;Character recognition;Image recognition;Speech recognition;Backpropagation algorithms;Learning systems;Smoothing methods","character recognition;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptive classifiers;machine learning applications;invariances;character recognition;spatial distortions;input images;classifier outputs;speed","","8","","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, this research finds a solution named AAC integrated Big Data Analytics Framework (AACBDAF) for people with neural disorders in the English language. AAC-BDAF gathers all the linguistic data and categorizes it based on how frequently it is used. To input data, the AAC system uses eyeball tracking to display symbols and characters on a screen. To help the listener follow along, the selected option/word is converted into a text-to-speech paradigm. The detection algorithms of machine learning and deep learning are evaluated for word detection and suggest the convolutional neural network (CNN) support AACBDAF.

It is important as a pre-processing step in information extraction, machine translation, question answering and many other natural language processing tasks. Ambiguity in Word Sense arises when a particular word has more than one possible sense. Finding the correct sense requires thorough knowledge regarding words. This information of words is often derived from the sources such as words appearing in the context of the target word, part of speech information of the words in the neighbour, syntactical relations and local collocations. Our main aim in this paper is to develop an automatic system for WSD in Assamese using a Naive Bayes classifier. This is the first work to the best of our knowledge on developing an automatic WSD system for Assamese language. Assamese, the main language of most of the people in North-Eastern part of India is a morphologically very rich language. In Assamese WSD is a challenging task because a word can behave differently when combined with a suffix or a sequence of suffixes to have an entirely different sense. WSD often makes use of lexical resources such as WordNet, lexicon, annotated or unannotated corpora etc for its process of disambiguation.","","978-1-4799-6629-5","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019726","Lexicon;Wordnet;Local collocations;Polysemic word;Unigram cooccurence","Training;Semantics;Context;Natural language processing;Dictionaries;Speech;Ink","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification","Assamese word sense disambiguation;supervised learning;WSD;information extraction;machine translation;question answering;natural language processing task;naive Bayes classifier;Assamese language;India;WordNet;lexicon;disambiguation process","","8","","14","IEEE","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study is orchestrated to provide gap analysis in available NER systems for Indian Languages, especially Hindi. It is because existing NER systems are evaluated for accuracies based on predefined datasets, which are not providing universal results on any dataset. Also, there is no standard dataset available for fair comparison of accuracies of Indian Languages. Furthermore, we concentrated our scope to Hindi as it is the official language of India and representative to other Indo-Aryan languages having similar structure, making it a generalized solution. Moreover, the scope of Named Entity tags are limited. Whereas, there is a scope of further classification of Named Entities.

The talk distinguishes information detection or retrieval (IR) from information extraction (IE) and describes recent advances in using IE technology for fast access to very large amounts of textual information in, for example, the world wide web and its extraction to a browsable database. This technology is now becoming available commercially and I describe a number of Language Engineering projects incorporating IE technology. It is argued that multilingual applications in IE/IR make the distinction between these information processing technologies and machine translation and automatic question answering and summarisation less clear than before, and they can now be combined in original ways to optimise information access via electronic text. Promising applications are mentioned in security, publishing, communications, finance, science, patents etc. The problems in advancing the field rapidly are described, particularly an appropriate interface, the modelling of the users needs and automatic adaptation of such systems to new domains. Summarisation used to be a traditional linguistic task, tackled by a range of techniques, but is now seen almost exclusively as a by produced of IR or IE technology, creating a text from the set of sentences containing the most improbable terms or by generating text from the content of IE templates.","","","10.1049/ic:19980962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=755358","","","information retrieval","information retrieval;information extraction;information summarisation;information detection;textual information;browsable database;multilingual applications;information processing technologies;machine translation;automatic question answering;electronic text;security;publishing;communications;finance;science;patents","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Our primary goal in this work is to break this myopic view by (i) proposing a new benchmark suite for DNN training, called TBD1, which comprises a representative set of eight DNN models and covers six major machine learning applications: image classification, machine translation, speech recognition, object detection, adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and (ii) performing an extensive performance analysis of these models on three major deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, MXNet, CNTK) across different hardware configurations (single-GPU, multi-GPU, and multi-machine). We present a new toolchain for performance analysis for these models that combines the targeted usage of existing performance analysis tools, careful selection of performance metrics, and methodologies to analyze the results. We also build a new set of tools for memory profiling in three major frameworks. These tools can shed light on precisely how much memory is consumed by different data structures (weights, activations, gradients, workspace) in DNN training. Using our tools and methodologies, we make several important observations and recommendations on where future DNN training research and optimization should be focused.","","978-1-5386-6780-4","10.1109/IISWC.2018.8573476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8573476","","Training;Benchmark testing;Tools;Graphics processing units;Computational modeling;Speech recognition;Hardware","data handling;data structures;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","deep neural network training;deep neural networks;DNN-related computation;trained models;image classification networks;primary benchmark;myopic view;benchmark suite;DNN training;representative set;DNN models;machine translation;speech recognition;object detection;adversarial networks;reinforcement learning;extensive performance analysis;deep learning frameworks;multiGPU;performance analysis tools;performance metrics;optimization;TBD;machine learning applications;hardware configurations","","71","","91","IEEE","13 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first step of identifying dialog act is identifying the boundary of the dialog act in utterances. In this paper, we focus on segmenting the utterance according to the dialog act boundaries, i.e. functional segments identification, for Vietnamese utterances. We investigate carefully functional segment identification in two approaches: (1) machine learning approach using maximum entropy (ME) and conditional random fields (CRFs); (2) deep learning approach using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a CRF layer (Bi-LSTM-CRF) on two different conversational datasets: (1) Facebook messages (Message data); (2) transcription from phone conversations (Phone data).

It affects directly on the accuracy of many other problems such as Syntax Parsing, WordSense Disambiguation, and Machine Translation. Stochastic models solve this problem relatively well, but they still make mistakes. Transformation-based learning (TBL) is a solution which can be used to improve stochastic taggers by learning a set of transformation rules. However, its rule learning algorithm has the disadvantages that rule templates must be prepared by hand and only rules are instances of rule templates can be generated. In this paper, we propose a model to learn transformation rules without rule templates. This model considers the rule learning problem as a feature selection problem. Experiments on PennTree Bank showed that the proposal model reduces errors of stochastic taggers with some tags.","","978-0-7695-3273-8","10.1109/ALPIT.2008.73","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4584333","","Training;Artificial neural networks;Entropy;Tagging;Stochastic processes;Accuracy;Proposals","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;stochastic processes","transformation rule-based learning;part-of-speech tagging;natural language processing;stochastic tagger model;feature selection problem","","3","","15","IEEE","1 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is formally known as Sign Language translation (SLT). Quite recently, SLT has been employed by making use of Convolution Neural Networks Models (CNN models) and are decently successful in achieving the target goal. SLT focuses on population who are hearing or speech-impaired. The technique, in focus, takes users' hand gestures as input images or videos and captures the relevant features to convert the same into an appropriate linguistic symbol. The entire process makes it convenient for users to interact with the world and vice versa. In an attempt to make life easier for a certain focused section of the society, SLT is widely studied and a large section of research is invested in this area. SLT gives out the results in the form of physical carriages, signal sets and/or countenances to deliver a particular message across. It is also helpful in delivering the correct emotional state of differently-abled people so that normal people can understand them better. This paper proposes a machine learning model which successfully and efficiently classifies hand gestures into spellings and sentences. Our survey study includes object detection and classification stages. In the preliminary stage, 10 english language letters are repeatedly fed into the system using varied signal images owing to background changes, lighting effects and positions variations. Training and testing data spaces are kept different to yield better result confidence. CNN algorithms are applied aggressively to improve the conversion accuracy.","","978-1-6654-7655-3","10.1109/ICCST55948.2022.10040464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040464","CNN;sign language;speech conversion;ISL;Natural language","Training;Computational modeling;Sociology;Symbols;Transforms;Linguistics;Assistive technologies","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;gesture recognition;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;image classification;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;object detection;pattern classification;sign language recognition","10 english language letters;appropriate linguistic symbol;CNN models;computational intelligence;Convolution Neural Networks Models;corresponding language text;focused section;hand gestures;hand-gestures recognition;important category;input images;linguistic sign gesture;machine learning model;Sign Language translation;SLT;social applicability;users;vision-based smart human computer interaction system","","","","16","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we pro­pose a trajectory transportation mode classification framework that is based on an end-to-end bidirectional LSTM classifier.

One issue with n-gram language models is that the language is not completely represented in the model. When words appear that are not in the model, we may need to provide a smoothing method to distribute the model probabilities over the unknown values. Many techniques exist for language model smoothing with many different performance characteristics. Often the performance of smoothing algorithms may depend on the application of the language model (so, for example, unigram models with interpolation smoothing may perform better with information retrieval applications, but trigram models with backoff smoothing might perform better for speech). This paper examines the relative performance of some selected smoothing methods with bigram language models created using chat data. The language models are used for machine translation of chat data and for creating text classification models.","","978-1-4673-2743-5","10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505411","","","language translation;natural language processing;pattern classification;smoothing methods;text analysis","ngram language models;human chats;speech applications;natural language systems;model probabilities;language model smoothing;smoothing algorithms;unigram models;interpolation smoothing;information retrieval applications;trigram models;backoff smoothing;bigram language models;chat data;text classification models","","3","","5","IEEE","22 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, it has become common to use data demanding deep neural models such as an encoder-decoder for GEC; thus, tackling the problem of data collection has become increasingly important. The incorporation of pseudo data in the training of GEC models is one of the main approaches for mitigating the problem of data scarcity. However, a consensus is lacking on experimental configurations, namely, (i) the methods for generating pseudo data, (ii) the seed corpora used as the source of the pseudo data, and (iii) the means of optimizing the model. In this study, these configurations are thoroughly explored through massive amount of experiments, with the aim of providing an improved understanding of pseudo data. Our main experimental finding is that pretraining a model with pseudo data generated by back-translation-based method is the most effective approach. Our findings are supported by the achievement of state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark test sets (the CoNLL-2014 test set and the official test set of the BEA-2019 shared task) without requiring any modifications to the model architecture.

Spoken-text normalization that converts spoken-style text into style normalized text is becoming an important technology for improving subsequent processing such as machine translation and summarization. The most successful spoken-text normalization method to date is sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) mapping using pointer-generator networks that possess a copy mechanism from an input sequence. However, these models require a large amount of paired data of spoken-style text and style normalized text, and it is difficult to prepare such a volume of data. In order to construct spoken-text normalization model from the limited paired data, we focus on self-supervised learning which can utilize unpaired text data to improve seq2seq models. Unfortunately, conventional self-supervised learning methods do not assume that pointer-generator networks are utilized. Therefore, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method, MAsked Pointer-Generator Network (MAPGN). The proposed method can effectively pre-train the pointer-generator net-work by learning to fill masked tokens using the copy mechanism.

However, due to the different semantic relations in Chinese, Chinese sentences usually have several ways of word segmentation, which leads to the problem of word segmentation ambiguity. Although Chinese character segmentation is not ambiguity, its meaning is not accurate and rich enough. And in different situations, the character and word are different in importance.

In recent years, due to the increase of the scale of the recurrent neural network, the software can speed up the network through the weight pruning network model compression technology. The acceleration of the cyclic neural network does not only stay in the aspect of software acceleration, but also in the aspect of hardware, the acceleration strategy includes the design of RNN accelerator based on GPU, FPGA and special ASIC circuit. The storage system almost determines the upper limit of the working efficiency of the accelerator. When the input data cannot be provided to the computing unit in time, the computing unit has to enter the idle state frequently, resulting in low working efficiency. Therefore, storage systems with continuous data feeds are very important for accelerators. This paper proposes a mapping mechanism of MVM operations on hardware operation units, and proposes a storage system with continuous data feeds.","","979-8-3503-0221-9","10.1109/ICNLP58431.2023.00085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10236742","Cyclic neural network;Efficient storage system;Data mapping mechanism","Neural network hardware;Recurrent neural networks;Graphics processing units;Speech recognition;Software;Hardware;Feeds","AI chips;application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;neural nets;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","acceleration strategy;computing unit;cyclic neural network acceleration;hardware operation units;memory system;recurrent neural network;recursive neural network hardware accelerator;RNN accelerator;software acceleration;storage system;weight pruning network model compression technology","","","","21","IEEE","6 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number of bits of the numerical representation is set to the minimum precision that is able to retain accuracy based on an offline profiling, and it is kept constant for DNN inference. In this work, we explore the use of dynamic precision selection during DNN inference. We focus on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which represent the state-of-the-art networks for applications such as machine translation and speech recognition. Unlike conventional DNNs, LSTM networks remember information from previous evaluations by storing data in the LSTM cell state. Our key observation is that the cell state determines the amount of precision required: time-steps where the cell state changes significantly require higher precision, whereas time-steps where the cell state is stable can be computed with lower precision without any loss in accuracy. We propose a novel hardware scheme that tracks the evolution of the elements in the LSTM cell state and dynamically selects the appropriate precision on each time-step. For a set of popular LSTM networks, it chooses the lowest precision for 57% of the time, outperforming systems that fix the precision statically. We evaluate our proposal on top of a modern highly-optimized LSTM accelerator, and show that it provides 1.46x speedup and 19.2% energy savings on average without degrading the model accuracy.

Large-scale LSTMs, which are deployed in many real-world applications, are highly compute intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AxLSTM, an application of approximate computing to improve the execution efficiency of LSTMs. An LSTM is composed of cells, each of which contains a cell state along with multiple gating units that control the addition and removal of information from the state. The LSTM execution proceeds in timesteps, with a new symbol of the input sequence processed at each timestep. AxLSTM consists of two techniques—Dynamic Timestep Skipping (DTS) and Dynamic State Reduction (DSR). DTS identifies, at runtime, input symbols that are likely to have little or no impact on the cell state and skips evaluating the corresponding timesteps. In contrast, DSR reduces the size of the cell state in accordance with the complexity of the input sequence, leading to a reduced number of computations per timestep. We describe how AxLSTM can be applied to the most common application of LSTMs, viz., sequence-to-sequence learning. We implement AxLSTM within the TensorFlow deep learning framework and evaluate it on 3 state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models. On a 2.7 GHz Intel Xeon server with 128 GB memory and 32 processor cores, AxLSTM achieves  $ {1.08\times -1.31 \times }$  speedups with minimal loss in quality, and  $ {1.12 \times -1.37 \times }$  speedups when moderate reductions in quality are acceptable.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2018.2858362","Semiconductor Research Corporation; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1423290); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8417946","Approximate computing;long short term memory (LSTM) networks;sequence-to-sequence learning","Approximate computing;Logic gates;Recurrent neural networks;Machine learning;Computational modeling;Embedded systems;Approximate computing;Long short term memory;Sequences","learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets","approximate computing;long Short Term Memory neural networks;recurrent neural networks;machine learning tasks;machine translation;text generation;speech recognition;AxLSTM;cell state;input sequence;DTS;DSR;sequence-to-sequence learning;TensorFlow deep learning framework;LSTM execution;dynamic state reduction;dynamic timestep skipping;Intel Xeon server","","31","","42","IEEE","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The author proposes a method for representing context information so that the correct meaning for a word in a sentence can be selected. The approach is primarily based upon work by Waltz and Pollack, who emphasized neurally plausible systems. By contrast the author focuses upon computationally feasible methods applicable to full-scale natural language processing systems. There are two key elements: a collection of context vectors defined for every word used by a natural language processing system, and a context algorithm that computes a dynamic context vector at any position in a body of text. Once the dynamic context vector has been computed it is easy to choose among competing meanings for a word. This choice of definitions is essentially a neural network computation, and neural network learning algorithms should be able to improve the system's choices. Good candidates for full-scale context vector implementations are machine translation systems and Japanese word processors.<>","","0-7803-0164-1","10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=155584","","Neural networks;Speech synthesis;Natural language processing;Testing;Synthesizers;Computer networks;Large-scale systems;Natural languages;Application software;Automatic control","learning systems;natural languages;neural nets","context representation;word sense disambiguation;neural networks;natural language processing systems;context vectors;learning algorithms;machine translation systems;Japanese word processors","","2","1","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, context-aware retrieval-based approaches are proposed for predicting motion lengths and generating proper 3D motions (C-MO). Specifically, we train a context-aware encoder-decoder model that uses the previous output of the decoder or the embedding vector of a ground truth motion as context so that the model becomes increasingly aware of previous alignments. Retrieving the most similar motions from the training set is based on the trained model given a text. Finally, we use the retrieval motion to guide the probability distribution for the final generated motions. Our method combines the advantages of both information retrieval and neural machine translation.

In this paper, taking NMT as a typical sequence generation task, we measure the accuracy of the generated sentence with various metrics and conduct a series of analyses to deeply understand the accuracy drop problem. We obtain several interesting findings. First, The role of error propagation on accuracy drop is overstated in the literature, although it is indeed a cause to the accuracy drop problem. Second, Characteristics of a language play a more important role in causing the accuracy drop problem: the left part of the generated sentence in a right-branching language (e.g., English) is more likely to be more accurate than its right part, while the right part is more accurate for a left-branching language (e.g., Japanese).

Speech emotion recognition (SER) is crucial in many real-time solutions, including human-robot interaction, assessing human behavior, and analyzing the emotional state of speakers. Due to its intricacy, SER is a task that is still difficult to complete but one that is becoming more and more crucial in emotional computing. Although there are many datasets available for SER, we are selecting RADVESS since we believe it to be the most ap-propriate. For many applications, such as a speech-to-speech translation system, feature selection can increase the accuracy of speech emotion recognition. Although tens of thousands of features can be retrieved from speech signals, it can be challenging to determine which elements are most closely associated to speaker emotional state. Most characteristics that are connected to emotional states are yet to be discovered. Mel Spectrogram and MFCC feature selection are the major topics of this research. Then passing these combined features through a modified CNN. In this paper we have used various neural network techniques (NN) for SER. The models we used include CNN, MLP, CNN-Attention-BiLSTM, Gradient Boosting.

These models are designed to fit within the limited area and energy constraints of the edge computing platforms, each targeting various applications (e.g., face detection, speech recognition, translation, image captioning, video analytics). To understand how edge ML accelerators perform, we characterize the performance of a commercial Google Edge TPU, using 24 Google edge NN models (which span a wide range of NN model types) and analyzing each NN layer within each model. We find that the Edge TPU suffers from three major shortcomings: (1) it operates significantly below peak computational throughput, (2) it operates significantly below its theoretical energy efficiency, and (3) its memory system is a large energy and performance bottleneck. Our characterization reveals that the one-size-fits-all, monolithic design of the Edge TPU ignores the high degree of heterogeneity both across different NN models and across different NN layers within the same NN model, leading to the shortcomings we observe. We propose a new acceleration framework called Mensa. Mensa incorporates multiple heterogeneous edge ML accelerators (including both on-chip and near-data accelerators), each of which caters to the characteristics of a particular subset of NN models and layers. During NN inference, for each NN layer, Mensa decides which accelerator to schedule the layer on, taking into account both the optimality of each accelerator for the layer and layer-to-layer communication costs. Our comprehensive analysis of the Google edge NN models shows that all of the layers naturally group into a small number of clusters, which allows us to design an efficient implementation of Mensa for these models with only three specialized accelerators. Averaged across all 24 Google edge NN models, Mensa improves energy efficiency and throughput by 3.0x and 3.1x over the Edge TPU, and by 2.4x and 4.3x over Eyeriss v2, a state-of-the-art accelerator.","","978-1-6654-4278-7","10.1109/PACT52795.2021.00019","Semiconductor Research Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9563028","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Visual analytics;Artificial neural networks;Machine learning;Throughput","inference mechanisms;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","machine learning accelerators;edge computing platforms;NN model types;NN layers;multiple heterogeneous edge ML accelerators;NN inference;Google neural network models;edge devices;emerging edge;machine learning inference bottlenecks;Google edge NN models;commercial Google edge TPU","","22","","103","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Cuneiform Commentaries Project (CPP) from Yale University provides tracings of cuneiform tablets with annotated transliterations and translations. As a part of our work analyzing cuneiform script computationally with 3D-acquisition and word-spotting, we present a first approach for automatized learning of transliterations of cuneiform tablets based on a corpus of parallel lines. These consist of manually drawn cuneiform characters and their transliteration into an alphanumeric code. Since the Cuneiform script is only available as raster-data, we segment lines with a projection profile, extract Histogram of oriented Gradients (HoG) features, detect outliers caused by tablet damage, and align those features with the transliteration. We apply methods from part-of-speech tagging to learn a correspondence between features and transliteration tokens. We evaluate point-wise classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM); sequence classification with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Structured Support Vector Machine (SVM-HMM). Analyzing our findings, we reach the conclusion that the sparsity of data, inconsistent labeling and the variety of tracing styles do currently not allow for fully automatized transliterations with the presented approach. However, the pursuit of automated learning of transliterations is of great relevance as manual annotation in larger quantities is not viable, given the few experts capable of transcribing cuneiform tablets.","2379-2140","978-1-5386-3586-5","10.1109/ICDAR.2017.106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8270037","Cuneiform;Transliteration;HMM;Machine Learning;Computer Linguistics;Online Databases;Handwriting Recognition;Language Modeling","Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Task analysis;Image segmentation;Microsoft Windows;Histograms","feature extraction;hidden Markov models;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;notebook computers;support vector machines;text analysis","parallel lines;cuneiform tablets;Cuneiform Commentaries Project;annotated transliterations;cuneiform script;cuneiform characters;transliteration tokens;fully automatized transliterations;CPP;3D-acquisition;3D-word-spotting;Yale University;structured support vector machine;hidden Markov model;SVM-HMM;k-nearest neighbors;KNN;histogram-of-oriented gradient feature extraction;HoG feature extraction","","4","","25","IEEE","29 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Similarly, a chatbot is a computer program that uses natural language processing and machine learning to simulate or mimic a conversation with human users. Chatbots can also be used for a variety of purposes, including customer services, marketing, and providing information. They can also be programmed to perform specific tasks such as making appointments, placing orders, or providing recommendations. The aim of the paper is to propose a hybrid system which combines the traditional voice assistance system with a chatbot. This is not only combining both the advantages of chatbots and voice assistants but also gives us the option of customize the software to users based on their needs. This Hybrid Multipurpose Voice Assistant uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert voice commands to instructions that will be sent to the voice assistant based on which it will perform the tasks. It uses Long Short-term Memory to process the instructions. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) which is capable of learning and maintaining a record of information for long periods of time. Unlike traditional RNNs, which have a tendency to lose information over longer sequences, LSTMs use a special type of memory cell called a “memory gate” to control the flow of information into and out of the network. This allows LSTMs to selectively choose which information to keep and which to discard, making them well-suited for tasks such as language translation and speech recognition. The proposed Hybrid Multi-Purpose voice assistant will be a cost effective and efficient system which will understand and respond to a user's requests better and the interactions will be more human like. This project will also aim at helping people with a variety of disabilities and will be a step forward in the direction of making people, who suffer from different types of disabilities, lives easier. This voice assistant can be run both locally on a person's computer or externally using servers based on the requirement as the program is scalable and can work with existing technology and architecture.","","978-1-6654-5630-2","10.1109/ICAAIC56838.2023.10140365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10140365","voice assistant;chatbot;speech recognition;users;Buddy;natural language processing","Recurrent neural networks;Virtual assistants;Speech recognition;Computer architecture;Oral communication;Chatbots;Software","chatbots;customer services;handicapped aids;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","chatbot;Google Assistant;Hybrid Multipurpose Voice Assistant;Hybrid MultiPurpose voice assistant;Hybrid MultiPurpose Voice Assistant;intelligent assistant;natural language processing;short-term memory;simple tasks;traditional voice assistance system;voice commands","","","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The presence of Arabic diacritics can be useful in many natural language processing applications, such as text-to-speech tasks, machine translation, and part-of-speech tagging. This article discusses the use of bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks with conditional random fields for Arabic diacritization. This approach requires no morphological analyzers, dictionary, or feature engineering, but rather uses a sequence-to-sequence schema. The input is a sequence of characters that constitute the sentence, and the output consists of the corresponding diacritic(s) for each character in that sentence. The performance of the proposed approach was examined using four datasets with different sizes and genres, namely, the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology text-to-speech (KACST TTS) dataset, the Holy Quran, Sahih Al-Bukhary, and the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB). For training, 60% of the sentences were randomly selected from each dataset, 20% were selected for validation, and 20% were selected for testing. The trained models achieved diacritic error rates of 3.41%, 1.34%, 1.57%, and 2.13% and word error rates of 14.46%, 4.92%, 5.65%, and 8.43% on the KACST TTS, Holy Quran, Sahih Al-Bukhary, and ATB datasets, respectively.

The first section describes the principle of learning matrices. So-called conditioned connections between the characteristics of an object and the meaning of an object are formed in the learning phase. During the operation of connecting the characteristics of an object with its meaning (EB operation of the knowing phase) upon presenting the object characteristics, the associated most similar meaning is realized in the form of a signal by maximum likelihood decoding. Conversely, in operation from the meaning of an object to its characteristics (BE operation) the associated object characteristics are obtained as signals by parallel reading upon application of an object meaning. According to the characteristic signals processed (binary or analog signals) discrimination must be made between binary and nonbinary learning matrices. In the case of the binary learning matrix the conditioned connections are a statistical measure for the frequency of the coordination of object characteristics and object meaning, in the case of the nonbinary learning matrix they are a measure for an analog value proportional to a characteristic. Both types of matrices allow for the characteristic sets applied during EB operation to be unsystematically disturbed within limits. Moreover, the nonbinary learning matrix is invariant to systematic deviations between presented and learned characteristic sets (invariance to affine transformation, translation and rotated skewness).","0367-7508","","10.1109/PGEC.1963.263588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4038032","","Circuits;Speech processing;Machine learning;Automatic control;Speech analysis;Signal processing;Frequency measurement;Filters;Speech recognition;National electric code","","","","78","2","34","IEEE","26 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, these methods do not fully exploit the characteristics of the lip dynamics, causing two main drawbacks. First, the short-range temporal dependencies, which are critical to the mapping from lip images to visemes, receives no extra attention. Second, local spatial information is discarded in the existing sequence models due to the use of global average pooling (GAP). To well solve these drawbacks, we propose a Temporal Focal block to sufficiently describe short-range dependencies and a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module (STFM) to maintain the local spatial information and to reduce the feature dimensions as well. From the experiment results, it is demonstrated that our method achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approach using much less training data and much lighter Convolutional Feature Extractor.

Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications to original ICs inserted by adversaries, which lead the system to malfunction after being triggered. The globalization of the semiconductor gives a chance for the adversary to conduct the hardware Trojan attacks.Previous works design Neural Network (NN) Trojans with access to the model, toolchain, and hardware platform. However, the threat model is impractical which hinders their real adoption. In this work, we propose a memory Trojan methodology without the help of toolchain manipulation and model parameter information. We first leverage the memory access patterns to identify the input image data. Then we propose a Trojan triggering method based on the dedicated input image other than the circuit events, which has better controllability.

Therefore, efficient LSTM accelerators at the edge are highly demanded. The limited resource in edge devices and the heterogeneous operations in LSTM (e.g., LSTM gates) bring challenges for the LSTM accelerator design. It seems straightforward to implement each operation as a specific hardware kernel. However, the data dependency among gates leads to significant running stalls in the existing heterogeneous-kernel accelerator, resulting in low parallelism and low resource utilization. To overcome the above challenges, this work proposes a novel generic LSTM accelerator design for Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Application-specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) platforms, where two fundamental computing patterns (i.e., element-wise multiplication and addition) are incorporated in a unified computing kernel to execute operations in all LSTM gates simultaneously. Thus, the running stalls caused by heterogeneous kernels can be eliminated, achieving full parallelism in LSTM. The proposed technique and architecture are validated on Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA which can fully utilize the available resource, achieving 10x faster in inference time and 15.2x improvement in computing power efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM accelerator.","2576-6996","978-1-7281-9710-4","10.1109/ICCD50377.2020.00086","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF CCF-1820537); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283568","Long Short-Term Memory;Edge computing;Accelerator;FPGA;ASIC","Schedules;Speech recognition;Parallel processing;Logic gates;Resource management;Kernel;Field programmable gate arrays","application specific integrated circuits;cloud computing;field programmable gate arrays;parallel processing;power aware computing;reconfigurable architectures;recurrent neural nets","long short-term memory;LSTM gates;unified computing kernel;full parallelism;unified accelerator design;generic LSTM accelerator design;speech recognition;word segmentation;machine translation;cloud platforms;data dependency;heterogeneous-kernel accelerator;low parallelism;low resource utilization;field-programmable gate array;application-specific integrated circuit platforms;Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA","","6","","23","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The geometric transformation is hierarchical, and it is decomposed into two steps. At first, the initial model is assumed to undergo a global similarity transformation modeled by translation, rotation, and scaling of the model components. Then, to increase the degrees of freedom of the model and allow it to capture fine data structures, each individual mixture component may be transformed by another, local similarity transformation, whose parameters are distinct for each component of the mixture. In addition, to constrain the order of magnitude of the local transformation (LT) with respect to the global transformation (GT), zero-mean Gaussian priors are imposed onto the local parameters. The estimation of both GT and LT parameters is obtained through the expectation maximization framework. Experiments on artificial data are conducted to evaluate the proposed model, with varying data dimensionality, number of model components, and transformation parameters. In addition, the method is evaluated using real data from a speech recognition task. The obtained results show a high model accuracy and demonstrate the potential application of the proposed method to similar classification problems.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2267803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549112","Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm;Gaussian mixture model;registration of point sets;similarity transformation","Estimation;Covariance matrices;Data models;Mixture models;Learning systems;Image registration","expectation-maximisation algorithm;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);signal classification;speech recognition","hierarchical similarity transformation;data space density estimation;Gaussian mixture model;hierarchical geometric transformation;global similarity transformation;model component translation;model component rotation;model component scaling;fine data structure capture;local similarity transformation;zero-mean Gaussian priors;expectation maximization framework;data dimensionality;transformation parameters;speech recognition task;classification problem;machine learning","","4","","34","IEEE","28 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Luz",NA; NA; NA,"Interacting with Computers","18 Jan 2018","2015","27","6","592","615","Wizard of Oz (WOZ) is a well-established method for simulating the functionality and user experience of future systems. Using a human wizard to mimic certain operations of a potential system is particularly useful in situations where extensive engineering effort would otherwise be needed to explore the design possibilities offered by such operations. The WOZ method has been widely used in connection with speech and language technologies, but advances in sensor technology and pattern recognition as well as new application areas such as human–robot interaction have made it increasingly relevant to the design of a wider range of interactive systems. In such cases, achieving acceptable performance at the user interface level often hinges on resource-intensive improvements such as domain tuning, which are better done once the overall design is relatively stable. Although WOZ is recognized as a valuable prototyping technique, surprisingly little effort has been put into exploring it from a methodological point of view. Starting from a survey of the literature, this paper presents a systematic investigation and analysis of the design space for WOZ for language technology applications, and proposes a generic architecture for tool support that supports the integration of components for speech recognition and synthesis as well as for machine translation. This architecture is instantiated in WebWOZ—a new web-based open-source WOZ prototyping platform. The viability of generic support is explored empirically through a series of evaluations. Researchers from a variety of backgrounds were able to create experiments, independent of their previous experience with WOZ. The approach was further validated through a number of real experiments, which also helped to identify a number of possibilities for additional support, and flagged potential issues relating to consistency in wizard performance.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iwu016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155004","natural language interfaces;HCI design and evaluation methods;speech based (interaction techniques);interface design prototyping","","","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For this study, a specific Natural Language Processing task is revisited, related to splitting an arbitrary sentence into phrases. In solving this task here, the central idea is to determine if domain-dependent information for expected near-symmetric parameter values can be exploited to reach a better solution in a given number of iterations. If there a known task-specific relation between parameters (for instance the order of magnitude of certain parameters is likely to be similar, as they correspond to similar inputs), the research question is whether such knowledge may be exploited to initially solve a simpler problem in a lower dimensionality. Thus, a hybrid strategy is proposed, that splits the PSO evolution into two phases, (i) the first one optimizing over a reduced set of grouped parameters in order to establish the relative magnitude of each group of related parameters and (ii) the second one optimizing over the entire set of parameters to fine-tune each parameter independently. Two PSO variants are evaluated on this strategy and for each case the results are compared to baselines, to investigate the quality of the solutions achieved. Experimental results indicate that the two variants behave differently with respect to this hybrid strategy, and that one of the PSO variants benefits to generate substantially better optimization solutions.","","978-1-5386-2726-6","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8285353","parsing of natural language;syntactically-derived phrasing;particle swarm optimization;parameter optimization;surrogate models","Task analysis;Optimization;Natural language processing;Force;Training data;Training","natural language processing;particle swarm optimisation;text analysis","optimization solutions;Natural Language Processing task;PSO evolution;known task-specific relation;domain-dependent information;NLP task;PSO-type algorithms;surrogate functions;hybrid strategy;PSO variants;grouped parameters;reduced set","","2","","16","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To evaluate the effectiveness of the extension, we developed optimized assembly functions for the fully connected and convolutional neural network layers. When using the extensions and the optimized assembly functions, we achieve an average clock cycle count decrease of 73% for a small scale convolutional neural network. On a per layer base, our optimizations decrease the clock cycle count for fully connected layers and convolutional layers by 72% and 78%, respectively.

Nowadays the use of IoT in industrial robots is very popular contrary to humanoid robots. There have been a few attempts that combine IoT with humanoid robots but they have limited features. This paper proposes a novel open source platform Android application for controlling a humanoid robot, with more features than other research projects, in remote areas either behind NAT (Network Address Translation) or without it. The user can view what the robot is seeing through the Android application and can also move it. Additionally, our system has the ability to deliver real-time audio through our application. We envision that our proposed system is not only an attractive solution for many telerobotic applications but also an extensive educational tool in special needs education.","","978-1-5386-2287-2","10.1109/PACET.2017.8259978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8259978","Android Application;Cyber-Physical Systems;Humanoid Robot;Internet of Thing (IoT);Real Time Control System;Telerobotics","Humanoid robots;Androids;Smart phones;Speech;Servers;Bridges","Android (operating system);humanoid robots;Internet of Things;mobile computing;public domain software;telerobotics","IoT;telerobotic applications;open source Android application;interrelated computing devices;mechanical machines;digital machines;Internet of Things humanoid robot;open source Android application","","2","","14","IEEE","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Application of AI in mental disorder therapies frequently has the form of dialogue systems. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a therapeutic chatbot capable of having a conversation in Polish. The initial work was focused on literature review and choosing the software framework for the dialogue system. As a next step, we have prepared a dataset of emotionally grounded dialogue turns in Polish, by applying machine translation to an existing resource for English. The resulting dataset was used for training an emotion recognition model which will be incorporated into the dialogue system. Next, the chatbot will be exposed to a group of test users, and its language understanding capabilities will be further developed. In future, the system will be equipped with a speech interface to also enable verbal communication. We plan to conduct experiments with the help of therapists and patients, followed by thorough analyses of their interactions with the chatbot.","","978-1-6654-0021-3","10.1109/ACIIW52867.2021.9666281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666281","chatbot;dialogue system;affective computing;emotion recognition;natural language processing;mental health","Training;Emotion recognition;Mental disorders;Conferences;Bibliographies;Medical treatment;Mental health","artificial intelligence;behavioural sciences computing;emotion recognition;interactive systems;language translation;medical disorders;natural language interfaces;natural language processing;patient treatment;speech-based user interfaces","dialogue system;therapeutic chatbot;Polish language;emotionally grounded dialogue;emotion recognition model;language understanding capabilities;therapeutic dialogue agent;mental disorder;computer-aided therapies;mental health;artificial intelligence;AI","","","","35","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the various attention mechanisms, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a powerful and popular variant. MHA helps the model to attend to different feature subspaces independently which is an essential component of Transformer. Despite its success, we conjecture that the different heads of the existing MHA may not collaborate properly. To validate this assumption and further improve the performance of Transformer, we study the collaboration problem for MHA in this paper. First, we propose the Single-Layer Collaboration (SLC) mechanism to help each attention head improve its attention distribution based on the feedback of other heads. Furthermore, we extend SLC to the cross-layer Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism. MHDC helps each MHA layer learn the attention distributions considering the knowledge from the other MHA layers. Both SLC and MHDC are implemented as lightweight modules with very few additional parameters. When equipped with these modules, our new framework, i.e., Collaborative TransFormer (CollFormer), significantly outperforms the vanilla Transformer on a range of NLP tasks, including machine translation, sentence semantic relatedness, natural language inference, sentence classification, and reading comprehension. Besides, we also carry out extensive quantitative experiments to analyze the properties of the MHDC in different settings. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and universality of MHDC as well as CollFormer.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3199648","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0106500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870037","Multi-head attention;multi-head collaboration;Transformer;attention model","Computational modeling;Semantics;Neural networks;Memory management;Collaboration;Transformers;Magnetic heads","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;pattern classification","NLP tasks;single-layer collaboration mechanism;cross-layer multihead dense collaboration mechanism;natural language inference;vanilla transformer;collaborative transformer;MHA layer;attention distribution;attention head;SLC;collaboration problem;feature subspaces;popular variant;powerful variant;multihead attention;natural language processing;neural network models;attention mechanism;MHDC","","","","61","IEEE","30 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing studies have limitations in text-image matching and multimodal semantic disparity reduction. For one thing, current methods fail to resolve both overall and local text-image matching issues in a self-guided way. For another, the static graphs constructed in MNER models are challenging in bridging the semantic gap between different modalities. In this work, a dynamic graph construction framework (DGCF) is proposed to solve the above-mentioned limitations. A similarity vector-based text-image matching inferring strategy is designed to obtain the overall and local matching relation between text and image while the overall matching determines the retained proportion of visual information. Then, a multimodal dynamic graph interaction module is developed. Within each layer of the module, the local matching relations and part of speech (POS)-based multihead attention are integrated to construct a dynamic cross-modal graph and a semantic graph. Lastly, a CRF layer is used to predict entity label. Extensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets.

Educating the blind to avoid unemployment among their population is one of the most challenging problems faced by blind schools today. Although many schools resort to the use of Braille to eradicate illiteracy among them, its steep learning curve, insufficient availability and high cost makes it quite unapproachable. Braille Literacy Statistics in India indicate that out of the 12 million blind people in the country, less than 10 percent learn Braille. It is evident that one of the most crucial issues faced by the blind and the visually impaired is the inability to read and learn without the use of Braille. In order to overcome this issue, there is a need to develop a system that can assist the visually impaired in reading. Hence, the proposed solution is to design an inexpensive wearable device that uses computer vision to read out any form of text around the user in various alignments and lighting conditions. The system makes use of a Raspberry Pi with a compatible camera to capture the content around the visually impaired or blind person and reads it out to them in a regional language. A sensor is also incorporated to notify the user of the distance to the nearest object at his eye level and the device enumerates various objects in its sight. The system is based on the combination of image processing, machine learning and speech synthesis techniques. The observed accuracy combining both the optical character recognition and the object recognition algorithms was found to be 84%.","","978-1-5386-5314-2","10.1109/ICACCI.2018.8554625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554625","Raspberry Pi;Optical Character Recognition (OCR);Object Recognition;Text to Speech;Language Translation","Optical character recognition software;Cameras;Object recognition;Google;Blindness;Text recognition;Instruction sets","computer vision;handicapped aids;learning (artificial intelligence);optical character recognition","blind person;machine learning;blind schools;lighting conditions;inexpensive wearable device;crucial issues;Braille Literacy Statistics;insufficient availability;steep learning curve;India;computer vision;visually impaired;assistive technology","","14","","14","IEEE","2 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adversarial machine learning (AML) focuses on exploring vulnerabilities and defensive techniques for machine learning models. Recent work has shown that most adversarial audio generation methods fail to consider audios’ temporal dependency (TD) (i.e., adversarial audios exhibit weaker TD than benign audios). As a result, the adversarial audios are easily detectable by examining their TD. Therefore, one area of interest in the audio AML community is to develop a novel attack that evades a TD-based detection model. In this contribution, we revisit the LSTM model for audio transcription and propose a new audio attack algorithm that evades the TD-based detection by explicitly controlling the TD in generated adversarial audios. The experimental results show that the detectability of our adversarial audio is significantly reduced compared to the state-of-the-art audio attack algorithms. Furthermore, experiments also show that our adversarial audios remain nearly indistinguishable from benign audios with only negligible perturbation magnitude.","","978-1-7281-2547-3","10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308597","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9308597","","Logic gates;Perturbation methods;Task analysis;Neural networks;Speech recognition;Security;Quantization (signal)","audio signal processing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","state-of-the-art audio attack algorithms;benign audios;adversarial audio attacks;evade temporal dependency;adversarial machine learning;machine learning models;adversarial audio generation methods;audio AML community;audio transcription;audio attack algorithm;generated adversarial audios","","","","26","IEEE","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework, dubbed BFGAN, to address this challenge. Specifically, we employ a backward generator and a forward generator to generate lexically constrained sentences together, and use a discriminator to guide the joint training of two generators by assigning them reward signals.

Researchers have increased LSTM depth by stacking LSTM cells to improve performance. This incurs model redundancy, increases run-time delay, and makes the LSTMs more prone to overfitting. To address these problems, we propose a hidden-layer LSTM (H-LSTM) that adds hidden layers to LSTM's original one-level nonlinear control gates. H-LSTM increases accuracy while employing fewer external stacked layers, thus reducing the number of parameters and run-time latency significantly. We employ grow-and-prune (GP) training to iteratively adjust the hidden layers through gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning of connections. This learns both the weights and the compact architecture of H-LSTM control gates. We have GP-trained H-LSTMs for image captioning, speech recognition, and neural machine translation applications. For the NeuralTalk architecture on the MSCOCO dataset, our three models reduce the number of parameters by 38.7× [floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 45.5×], run-time latency by 4.5×, and improve the CIDEr-D score by 2.8 percent, respectively.

The Main feature is Image Caption Generation, i.e., not only it is responsible for Image Segmentation, Object classification but it also establishes a relation between the objects classified that too with a logical relation that somehow gives the human vibe. Encoder-decoder model has been used. CNN has been used for Image and LSTM has been used for text. The paper also demonstrates the integration InceptionV3 model. Vision360 is a way of providing aid to blind people or partially blind people. It’s a way to bring convenience in their proximity in a single touch. It tries to bridge the gap that they have been feeling all along while walking on the same path with different people. A task to describe an Image is not very hard but if we want to automate this task of depicting something from an image and make the machine do it, it’ll be nearly impossible, even if the new researches have been made and feature extraction is attainable. Logically establishing semantically and syntactically correct sentences is still a hard task to accomplish. We used encoder-decoder model for parallel training of Image and text data, and used InceptionV3 for extracting feature vector. We evaluated our result on BLEU score metric and the model achieved BLEU score in-range of 0.70 to 0.78 for various images in the validation set.","","978-1-6654-3701-1","10.1109/Confluence52989.2022.9734167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9734167","CNN;LSTM;Feature extraction","Training;Measurement;Legged locomotion;Image segmentation;Image coding;Blindness;Feature extraction","computational linguistics;feature extraction;grammars;handicapped aids;image classification;image segmentation;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","Image Caption Generation;encoder-decoder model;Image Segmentation;Object classification;logical relation;integration InceptionV3 model;partially blind people;feature extraction;text data;feature vector","","","","20","IEEE","21 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this progress is limited to English and European languages and low resource languages lack such tools due paucity of resources. In this paper, we develop UBERT22- an unsupervised pre-trained BERT model for Urdu language. For this purpose, first, we develop a dataset of ‘Zakheera’ containing high-quality content of 1.16 million Urdu language news and blog articles posted on top 37 Urdu websites. Next, we pre-process the text and tokenize content in 21.8 million Urdu sentences. Finally, we extract the word-piece vocabulary of 30,000 tokens and pre-train the BERT model for Masked Language Modelling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) tasks. We compare the performance of UBERT22 with existing multilingual and small-Urdu BERT for various downstream tasks. We notice that UBERT22 outperforms multilingual and small-Urdu BERT for fake news identification, propaganda classification, topic categorization, and sentiment analysis tasks. Overall, UBERT22 achieves 2-19% higher accu-racy compared to baseline results and competitive BERT models. We believe that the public availability of our pre-trained model and upstream dataset will enable the development of state-of-the-art NLP models of Urdu language such as chatbots, question answering systems, sentiment analyzers, virtual assistants, speech recognizers, and machine translators.","2770-8225","978-1-6654-6477-2","10.1109/ICOSST57195.2022.10016821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016821","Urdu BERT;text classification;NLU model","Analytical models;Vocabulary;Sentiment analysis;Bit error rate;Blogs;Speech recognition;Predictive models","language translation;natural language processing;natural languages;text analysis;Web sites","37 Urdu websites;competitive BERT models;European languages;high-quality content;low resource languages;low resource Urdu;Masked Language Modelling;Natural Language Understanding tools;Next Sentence Prediction tasks;small-Urdu BERT;state-of-the-art NLP models;tokenize content;UBERT22 outperforms;unsupervised pre-trained BERT model;Urdu language","","","","31","IEEE","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But when it comes to eavesdropping, people usually pay attention to devices like cameras and mobile phones, instead of small-volume and battery-free RFID tags. This work shows the possibility of using prevalence RFIDs to capture and recognize the acoustic signals. To be specific, we attach an RFID tag on an object, which is located in the vicinity of the sound source. Our key innovation lies in the translation between the vibrations induced when the sound wave hits the object surface and the fluctuations in the tag's RF signals. Although the inherent sampling rate of commercial RFID devices is deficient, and the vibrations are very subtle, we still extract characteristic features from imperfect measurements by taking advantage of state-of-the-art machine learning and signal processing algorithms. We have implemented our system with commercial RFID and loudspeaker equipment and evaluated it intensively in our lab environment. Experimental results show that the average success rate in detecting single tone sounds can reach as high as 93.10%.

Although both models have been extended in several ways (eg. Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit architectures, Variational RNN, partially observed Markov models...), their theoretical understanding remains partially open. In this context, our approach consists in classifying both models from an information geometry point of view. More precisely, both models can be used for modeling the distribution of a sequence of random observations from a set of latent variables; however, in RNN, the latent variable is deterministically deduced from the current observation and the previous latent variable, while, in HMM, the set of (random) latent variables is a Markov chain. In this paper, we first embed these two generative models into a generative unified model (GUM). We next consider the subclass of GUM models which yield a stationary Gaussian observations probability distribution function (pdf). Such pdf are characterized by their covariance sequence; we show that the GUM model can produce any stationary Gaussian distribution with geometrical covariance structure. We finally discuss about the modeling power of the HMM and RNN submodels, via their associated observations pdf: some observations pdf can be modeled by a RNN, but not by an HMM, and vice versa; some can be produced by both structures, up to a re-parameterization.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999058","Recurrent Neural Networks;Hidden Markov Models","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Recurrent neural networks;Covariance matrices;Probability density function;Gaussian distribution","Gaussian distribution;hidden Markov models;probability;recurrent neural nets","HMM;latent variable;Markov chain;generative unified model;GUM model;stationary Gaussian observations probability distribution function;stationary Gaussian distribution;RNN submodels;recurrent neural networks;Hidden Markov Models;sequential data;long short term memory;gated recurrent unit architectures;variational RNN","","7","","14","IEEE","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For organisations that place a premium on efficiency, automation is the ultimate aim, and natural language processing is key to getting there. A machine can only completely comprehend humans when it talks with them in human language; it’s like speaking to someone in your mother tongue as opposed to someone you hardly understand or can barely speak. It is closed using natural language processing. . This paper will examine how a machine can truly comprehend human language while also delving into the specific algorithms that are employed. This essay will examine text conversions in-depth and go over how natural language processing proceeds. For those who are curious about the fundamentals of comprehending and mastering natural language processing, this review essay may be helpful. Natural language processing has a wide range of applications, including text processing, summarization, translation, voice and speech recognition, AI-powered user interfaces, expert systems, and more. However, Despite advances, NLP still faces challenges in accurately detecting emotions and expressions conveyed through non-verbal cues such as voice tone and body language.

We propose an emotion-aware transformer encoder for capturing the emotional quotient in the user utterance in order to generate human-like empathetic responses. The contributions of our paper are as follows: 1) An emotion detector module trained on the input utterances determines the affective state of the user in the initial phase 2) A novel transformer encoder is proposed that adds and normalizes the word embedding with emotion embedding thereby integrating the semantic and affective aspects of the input utterance 3) The encoder and decoder stacks belong to the Transformer-XL architecture which is the recent state of the art in language modeling. Experimentation on the benchmark Facebook AI empathetic dialogue dataset confirms the efficacy of our model from the higher BLEU-4 scores achieved for the generated responses as compared to existing methods.

Extractive summarization chooses important sentences from the text to form a summary whereas abstractive summarization paraphrase using advanced and nearer-to human explanation by adding novel words or phrases. For a human annotator, producing summary of a document is time consuming and expensive because it requires going through the long document and composing a short summary. An automatic feature-rich model for text summarization is proposed that can reduce the amount of labor and produce a quick summary by using both extractive and abstractive approach. A feature-rich extractor highlights the important sentences in the text and linguistic characteristics are used to enhance results. The extracted summary is then fed to an abstracter to further provide information using features such as named entity tags, part of speech tags and term weights. Furthermore, a loss function is introduced to normalize the inconsistency between word-level and sentence-level attentions. The proposed two-staged network achieved a ROUGE score of 37.76% on the benchmark CNN/DailyMail dataset, outperforming the earlier work.

Hence, the ambiguous punctuation marks must be distinguished, and the sentence structure must be correctly encoded in language models. This study proposed a component-level Tibetan SBD approach based on the DL model. The models can reduce the error amplification caused by word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. Although most SBD methods have only considered text on the left side of punctuation marks, this study considers the text on both sides. In this study, 465 669 Tibetan sentences are adopted, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model is used to perform SBD.

Finally, a resolution aware NP Windows algorithm is proposed, to improve robustness to relative scaling between an image-pair. Comparative testing of 2D image registration was performed using translation-only and affine transformations. Although more expensive than other methods, NP Windows frequently demonstrated superior performance for bias (distance between ground truth and global maximum) and frequency of convergence. Unlike other methods, the number of samples and histogram bin-size has little effect on NP Windows, and the prior selection of a kernel is not required.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407723","Interpolation;Optimization;Distribution functions;Nonparametric statistics;Antialiasing;Image-based rendering;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Sampling;Signal processing;Interpolation;Optimization;Distribution functions;Nonparametric statistics;Antialiasing;Image-based rendering;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Sampling;Signal processing","Statistics;Mutual information;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Statistical distributions;Image sampling;Interpolation;Robustness;Testing;Image registration","affine transforms;Green's function methods;image registration;interpolation","joint statistics;nonparametric windows;image registration;mutual information;interpolation model;Green's theorem;affine transformations","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","23","","30","IEEE","19 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Emerging Nanophotonic technology has been employed for on-chip data communication, because of its CMOS compatibility, high bandwidth and low power consumption. In this paper, we propose a nanophotonic accelerator, HolyLight, to boost the CNN inference throughput in datacenters. Instead of an all-photonic design, HolyLight performs convolutions by photonic integrated circuits, and process the other operations in CNNs by CMOS circuits for high inference accuracy. We first build HolyLight-M by microdisk-based matrix-vector multipliers. We find analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) seriously limit its inference throughput per Watt. We further use microdisk-based adders and shifters to architect HolyLight-A without ADCs.

This article focuses on exploring the implications of hardware Trojan attacks on DNNs. Trojans are one of the most challenging threat models in hardware security where adversaries insert malicious modifications to the original integrated circuits (ICs), leading to malfunction once being triggered. Such attacks can be conducted by adversaries because modern ICs commonly include third-party intellectual property (IP) blocks. Previous studies design hardware Trojans to attack DNNs with the assumption that adversaries have full knowledge or manipulation of the DNN systems' victim model and toolchain in addition to the hardware platforms, yet such a threat model is strict, limiting their practical adoption. In this article, we propose a memory Trojan methodology that implants the malicious logics merely into the memory controllers of DNN systems without the necessity of toolchain manipulation or accessing to the victim model and thus is feasible for practical uses. Specifically, we locate the input image data among the massive volume of memory traffics based on memory access patterns and propose a Trojan trigger mechanism based on detecting the geometric feature in input images. Extensive experiments show that the proposed trigger mechanism is effective even in the presence of environmental noises and preprocessing operations. Furthermore, we design and implement the payload and verify that the proposed Trojan technique can effectively conduct both untargeted and targeted attacks on DNNs.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2020.2995347","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1725447,1730309); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096397","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning accelerator;deep learning attack;hardware Trojan","Trojan horses;Hardware;Integrated circuit modeling;Computational modeling;Security;Payloads","deep learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","memory access patterns;Trojan trigger mechanism;untargeted attacks;practical attacks;memory trojaning;deep neural network accelerators;computer vision;speech recognition;machine translation applications;hardware Trojan attacks;hardware security;adversaries insert malicious modifications;original integrated circuits;modern ICs;third-party intellectual property blocks;DNN systems;hardware platforms;threat model;practical adoption;malicious logics;memory controllers;toolchain manipulation;victim model;practical uses;input image data;memory traffics;memory Trojan;geometric feature detection","","11","","74","IEEE","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Arguably, novel waveforms that can proactively adapt to anticipated channel conditions may better meet the challenges of the tactical environment. This motivates the ability to accurately predict spectral behaviour in real-time. A Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) network is a type of recurrent neural network which has been extremely successful in dealing with time-dependent signal processing problems such as speech recognition and machine translation. In this paper, we apply it to the task of spectral prediction and present a module generator for a latency-optimised Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation. We show that our implementation obtains superior results to other time series prediction techniques including a naïve predictor, moving average and ARIMA for the problem of radio frequency spectral prediction.

To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200×200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies.

We first evaluate its ability to capture similarities among captions corresponding to the same audio file and compare it to other established metrics. We then propose a fine-tuning method to directly optimize the metric by backpropagating through a sentence embedding extractor and audio captioning network. Such fine-tuning results in an improvement in predicted captions as measured by both traditional metrics and the proposed semantic similarity captioning metric.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10096522","audio captioning;semantic similarity;sentence embedding","Measurement;Gold;Computational modeling;Semantics;Area measurement;Signal processing;Acoustics","","","","","","21","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to the general dropout method, which randomly drops neurons, DropDim drops part of the embedding dimensions. In this way, the semantic information can be completely discarded. Thus, the excessive co-adapting between different embedding dimensions can be broken, and the self-attention is forced to encode meaningful features with a certain number of embedding dimensions erased. Experiments on a wide range of tasks executed on the MUST-C English-Germany dataset show that DropDim can effectively improve model performance, reduce over-fitting, and show complementary effects with other regularization methods. When combined with label smoothing, the WER can be reduced from 19.1% to 15.1% on the ASR task, and the BLEU value can be increased from 26.90 to 28.38 on the MT task.

In particular, we propose the MotionGAN which transforms an input face image into a new one according to a heatmap of target landmarks. We show that it is possible to create very realistic face videos using a single image and a set of target landmarks. Furthermore, our method can be used to edit a facial image with arbitrary motions according to landmarks (e.g., expression, speech, etc.).

The current methodology in deep learning consists of employing a data-driven approach to identify the best architecture of an ANN that allows input-output data pairs to be fitted. Once the ANN is trained, it is capable of responding to never-observed inputs by providing the optimum output based on past acquired knowledge. In this context, a recent trend in the deep-learning community complements purely data-driven approaches with prior information based on expert knowledge.

These applications are backed by large DNN models running in serving mode on a cloud computing infrastructure to process client inputs such as images, speech segments, and text segments. Given the compute-intensive nature of large DNN models, a key challenge for DNN serving systems is to minimize the request response latencies. This paper characterizes the behavior of different parallelism techniques for supporting scalable and responsive serving systems for large DNNs. We identify and model two important properties of DNN workloads: 1) homogeneous request service demand and 2) interference among requests running concurrently due to cache/memory contention. These properties motivate the design of serving deep learning systems fast (SERF), a dynamic scheduling framework that is powered by an interference-aware queueing-based analytical model. To minimize response latency for DNN serving, SERF quickly identifies and switches to the optimal parallel configuration of the serving system by using both empirical and analytical methods. Our evaluation of SERF using several well-known benchmarks demonstrates its good latency prediction accuracy, its ability to correctly identify optimal parallel configurations for each benchmark, its ability to adapt to changing load conditions, and its efficiency advantage (by at least three orders of magnitude faster) over exhaustive profiling. We also demonstrate that SERF supports other scheduling objectives and can be extended to any general machine learning serving system with the similar parallelism properties as above.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2018.2808352","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1218758,CCF-1649087,CCF-1756013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8298516","Deep learning;DNN serving;scheduling;parallelism;performance;analytical model;interference-aware","Parallel processing;Computational modeling;Neurons;Servers;Load modeling;Neural networks;Benchmark testing","cloud computing;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;scheduling","SERF;good latency prediction accuracy;optimal parallel configuration;general machine learning;efficient deep neural network serving;deep neural networks;artificial intelligence applications;image recognition;drug discovery;machine vision;DNN models;compute-intensive nature;key challenge;DNN serving systems;request response latencies;different parallelism techniques;scalable serving systems;responsive serving systems;DNN workloads;deep learning systems;dynamic scheduling framework;interference-aware queueing;DNN;cache-memory contention","","11","","61","IEEE","21 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SL is the main communication means for the deaf / dumb community. They usually communicate through a multitude of hand gestures. The correct interpretation of SL is all the more important, since the deaf and dumb constitute nearly 90 million of the world population. Therefore sign language recognition (SLR) and translation is a fertile area of research. The two main approaches for SLR are (i) image based and (ii) sensor based. Image based approach involves one or more cameras to capture an image sequence of the signer performing the sign, and then uses image processing to recognize the sign.

At KIT the Focus Anthropomatics and Robotics - APR has been set up by a number of research groups focusing on the research field of Anthropomatics and Robotics with more than 250 researchers. Modelling humans and their capabilities requires a deep understanding of the principle of biomechanics and kinematics, as well as the underlaying neural control principles and the perceptive and actuatoric system. Modelling and understanding of the sensomotoric mechanisms, learning and developement of skills and cognititve capabilities to enable humans to interact with the world is of high importance to design technical systems operating closely and interactively with humans via various modalities like speech, haptics, vision, grasping and locomotion. Typical research fields are related to active vision, interpretation of scenes and human activities, recognition and tracking technologies multimodal & perceptual user interfaces, understanding and translation of speech. Complementary research needed is related to the retrieval & access and summarization of multimedia data sources, translation of spoken text, context aware learning computers, implicit services and many more. The robotics application field ranges from interactive industrial robotics, service robotic companions, humanoids and medical robotics. In all domains the integrating aspects are focusing on algorithms processing real word data as well as open self-organizing architectures which allow autonomy, skill and task learning as well as interaction with humans. Our research emphasizes the critical path from basic understanding of cognitive processes and robotics foundations to applications in various domains. The research includes new approaches to sensor and actuator methodologies, foundations of machine perception, motion and action planning algorithms, simulation and computer graphics, robot machine learning, speech recognition and understanding, multimodal man-machine interaction, and many others. APR addresses the needs of humans in smart living environments and robotics focusing on both, basic foundations and applications. The focus has an intellectual center point on Anthropomatics and a commitment to Robotics as a new human centered discipline. The research is to explore new ideas and to build systematically systems which reflect human daily needs and a basic understanding of intelligent robots and adaptive safe system behaviour in general. Such cognitive robots are able to do tasks skillfully and efficiently together with humans, and they should be able to operate in dangerous or inaccessible areas. Furthermore, future robots should discover new things and learn new capabilities and knowledge about their environment and they should be able to reason about the effects of their actions and interventions. Thus, the basic capabilities to perform intelligent actions in the real world are perception, cognition, locomotion and skillful manipulation. The humanoid robot series ARMAR is used to illustrate recent research and achieved results in the field.","1944-9437","978-1-4577-1573-0","10.1109/ROMAN.2011.6005213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005213","","","","","","","1","","IEEE","29 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model, called a platform-independent model (PIM), is used to derive automatically or semi-automatically the source code of a system. Different knowledge-based approaches have been proposed to extract a PIM from a textual specification automatically. These approaches use a predefined set of rules to perform this discovery. These approaches impose several restrictions on the way a specification is written. The emergence of machine learning techniques and more specifically of deep learning and their obvious success among others in several tasks in automatic language processing, such as speech recognition and translation, suggests the possibility of using these techniques to reach our objective.

Furthermore, there are additional challenges specific to Indian languages and the India context. This report summarizes the current metrics and datasets used for the evaluation of various technologies and identifies gaps that need to be addressed. Since there were dedicated subcommittees on speech, text, script, and accessibility, therefore, this report does not go into the details of various evaluation issues specific to these subareas.

ASNs can be used in tracking speakers, enhancing the speaker's speech and human-machine interactions, etc., but the geometric structure of the ASN has to be calibrated. ASN geometry calibration is a challenging task due to the irregular geometric structures of ASNs. A three-dimensional (3D) node geometry calibration approach based on direction of arrival (DOA) measurements and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The theoretical DOAs of sound sources relative to nodes are first derived based on 3D rotation matrices and translation vectors, and the corresponding measured DOAs are estimated by the time-difference-of-arrival. Then, the node geometry calibration problem is formulated as the minimization of a cost function measuring the mismatch between theoretical and measured DOAs, and such non-convex minimization is effectively solved by the ABC algorithm. Next, Cramér-Rao bound is presented to provide a theoretical lower bound for DOA-based node geometry calibration. Finally, the sensitivity of the proposed method to the sound source position error is discussed. The proposed method can calibrate node geometry positions successfully in both 2D plane and 3D space and requires no information transmission among nodes when the positions of few sound sources and the relative geometry of microphones in each node are known. Experimental results reveal the validity of the proposed node geometry calibration method.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2019.2921892","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771091,61871066); National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2015AA016306); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:20170540159); Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:DUT17LAB04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735787","Acoustic sensor network;node geometry calibration;direction of arrival;artificial bee colony algorithm;Cramér–Rao bound","Geometry;Calibration;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Microphones;Three-dimensional displays;Estimation;Cost function","artificial bee colony algorithm;calibration;concave programming;direction-of-arrival estimation;geometry;matrix algebra;microphones;minimisation;wireless sensor networks","acoustic sensor networks;Cramér-Rao bound;sensitivity analysis;tracking speakers;geometric structure;ASN geometry calibration;irregular geometric structures;three-dimensional node geometry calibration approach;artificial bee colony algorithm;theoretical DOAs;3D rotation matrices;time-difference-of-arrival;node geometry calibration problem;ABC algorithm;DOA-based node geometry calibration;sound source position error;node geometry positions;node geometry calibration method;non-convex minimization;directional of arrival measurements;DOA-based three-dimensional node geometry calibration","","6","","37","IEEE","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, because some studies have not considered comprehensive information that affects house prices, prediction results are not always sufficiently precise. Therefore, we propose an end to end joint self-attention model for house prediction. In this model, we import data on public facilities such as parks, schools, and mass rapid transit stations to represent the availability of amenities, and we use satellite maps to analyze the environment surrounding houses. We adopt attention mechanisms, which are widely used in image, speech, and translation tasks, to identify crucial features that are considered by prospective house buyers. The model can automatically assign weights when given transaction data. Our proposed model differs from self-attention models because it considers the interaction between two different features to learn the complicated relationship between features in order to increase prediction precision. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the performance of the model. Experimental data include actual selling prices in real estate transaction data for the period from 2017 to 2018, public facility data acquired from the Taipei and New Taipei governments, and satellite maps crawled using the Google Maps application programming interface. We utilize these datasets to train our proposed and compare its performance with that of other machine learning-based models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting and Light Gradient Boosted Machine, deep learning, and several attention models. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves a low prediction error and outperforms the other models.

As with other industries, such as mobile, business, transportation, gaming, robotics, security, education. Much like non-intelligent automation, artificial intelligence applications can be trained to perform human-like tasks. Some of the common skills currently imitated by AI include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and adaptability — AI tools can be applied to perform tasks that were impossible to accomplish. AI performs tasks faster and with greater precision than their experience human counterparts. AI applications are beginning to augment the creative decision making skills of the production and distribution team, enabling energy, talent and enthusiasm to be focused on what only humans can do. At least for now. — During the M&E creative production process images, sound, and metadata are collected and stored, analyzed, identified and selected. Recovery of content from the media libraries and archives is critical to the creative process. This includes production generated multiple media formats of video, audio, graphics, and other types of data including text, scripts, and playlists. — It takes multiple tools to organize, collate and curate media and data from different formats and types. Metadata creation technologies help create the metadata necessary for content search and retrieval. While several logging and recognition technologies can generate some metadata automatically, the results are often incomplete inaccurate and far from comprehensive. — AI can be applied to myriad applications enhancing, accelerating and increasing the capacity of the media supply chain: AI services such transcription, language and dialect translation. face and object recognition, social media sentiment analysis. geolocation and fingerprinting are just a few examples. — Newly developed artificial intelligence for media asset management fuses the ability to understand all media and data types and perform discovery, synthesize and curate. — Across the media supply chain employing automated technologies that can create the metadata, then index and catalog it during the creation or acquisition process would help the creative process downstream. There is a still a requirement for the creative team to identify relationaships and the preferred clip selection. It needs the legal team to add permissions, control access, contractual distribution and expiration criteria. In news production using ML techniques with pattern matching, additional content can be identified.","","978-1-61482-960-7","10.5594/M001817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8609876","AI;Artificial Intelligence;machine learning;Deep learning;inference;semantic;metadata;MAM;DAM;PAM;asset management;media management","","","","","","","2","","13 Jan 2019","","","SMPTE","SMPTE Conferences"

Combining evolutionary computation and neural architecture search (NAS) is an important approach to improve the performance of deep neural networks. Usually, the related researchers only focus on precision. Thus, the searched neural architectures always perform poorly in the other indexes such as time cost. In this article, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a probability stack (MOEA-PS) is proposed for NAS, which considers the two objects of precision and time consumption. MOEA-PS uses an adjacency list to represent the internal structure of deep neural networks. Besides, a unique mechanism is introduced into the multi-objective genetic algorithm to guide the process of crossover and mutation when generating offspring. Furthermore, the structure blocks are stacked using a proxy model to generate deep neural networks. The results of the experiments on Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a similar error rate compared with the most advanced NAS algorithms, but the time cost is lower. Finally, the network structure searched on Cifar-10 is transferred directly to the ImageNet dataset, which can achieve 73.6% classification accuracy.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3252612","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876089,61876185,61902281); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20141005); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:14KJB520025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059145","Deep learning;evolutionary computation;multi-objective optimization;neural architecture search (NAS)","Computer architecture;Classification algorithms;Statistics;Sociology;Graphics processing units;Neural networks;Evolutionary computation","deep learning (artificial intelligence);evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;image classification;natural language processing;neural net architecture;object detection;search problems;speech recognition","deep neural networks;MOEA-PS;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective genetic algorithm;neural architecture search;object detection;probability stack;searched neural architectures","","3","","51","IEEE","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following the analogy with machine translation, we propose a statistical formulation of style conversion based on integration of a music language model of the target style and an edit model representing the similarity between the original and arranged melodies. In supervised-learning approaches for constructing style-specific language models, it has been crucial to use data that properly specify a music style. To reduce reliance on manual data selection and annotation, we propose a novel statistical model that can spontaneously discover styles in pitch and rhythm organization. We also point out the importance of an edit model that incorporates syntactic functions of notes such as tonic and build a model that can infer such functions unsupervisedly.

"Deep Learning Transformer Architecture for Named-Entity Recognition on Low-Resourced Languages: State of the art results","R.

In addition, these DL transformer models were com-pared to other Neural Network and Machine Learning (ML) NER models. The findings show that transformer models substantially improve performance when applying discrete fine-tuning parameters per language. Furthermore, fine-tuned transformer models outperform other neural network and ma-chine learning models on NER with the low-resourced SA languages. For example, the transformer models obtained the highest F-scores for six of the ten SA languages and the highest average F-score surpassing the Conditional Random Fields ML model. Practical implications include developing high-performance NER capability with less effort and resource costs, potentially improving downstream NLP tasks such as Machine Translation (MT). Therefore, the application of DL trans-former architecture models for NLP NER sequence tagging tasks on low-resourced SA languages is viable. Additional re-search could evaluate the more recent transformer architecture models on other Natural Language Processing tasks and applications, such as Phrase chunking, MT, and Part-of-Speech tagging.","","978-83-962423-9-6","10.15439/2022F53","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9909310","4Named-Entity Recognition;Natural Language Processing;Neural Networks;Sequence Tagging;XLM-R;Machine Learning;Transformer Models","Deep learning;Costs;Computational modeling;Government;Artificial neural networks;Tagging;Transformers","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","SA languages;highest average F-score;Conditional Random Fields ML model;high-performance NER capability;resource costs;DL trans-former architecture models;NLP NER sequence;recent transformer architecture models;Natural Language Processing tasks;named-entity recognition;low-resourced languages;South African languages;DL transformer models;fine-tuning parameters;fine-tuned transformer models;neural network;ma-chine learning models","","","","21","","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The information about syntactic complexity is crucial for successful solution of many practical NLP tasks starting from intellectual understanding of texts and ending with automatic machine translation. Because of this, syntactic complexity and its measures are in the center of attention of NLP developers. Thus far, quite a series of different measures of syntactic complexity have been developed; in this paper, it is proposed to consider 10 syntactic measures that have been proposed for syntactic stylometric analysis. The pilot experiment described in this paper was made on automatic syntactic text annotation made by UDPipe syntactic parser, which was manually corrected. In our approach, particular attention is paid to the analysis of stability of certain measures of syntactic complexity and the analysis of their variation. Thus, we try to evaluate, which syntactic properties of Russian texts may be considered as inherent for the language as a whole, and which of them undergo some changes. To achieve this task, we analyze the corpus of Russian literary texts for three decades. Due to their high stylistic variability, texts of fiction may be considered as excellent data for assessing different levels of complexity. The obtained results show the effectiveness of different measures for estimating text syntactic complexity and revealing their correlation.","2305-7254","978-952-69244-3-4","10.23919/FRUCT49677.2020.9211027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9211027","","Syntactics;Complexity theory;Task analysis;Linguistics;Time measurement;Frequency measurement;Market research","computational linguistics;grammars;natural language processing;text analysis","syntactic measures;syntactic stylometric analysis;automatic syntactic text annotation;UDPipe syntactic parser;syntactic properties;text syntactic complexity;Russian texts;stylistic variability","","5","","45","","2 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If a language contains complex words like sandhi where two or more morphemes join based on some rules, spell checking becomes very tedious. In such situations, having a spell checker with sandhi splitter which alerts the user by flagging the errors and providing suggestions is very useful. A novel algorithm of sandhi splitting is proposed in this paper. The sandhi splitter can split about 7000 most common sandhi words in Kannada language used as test samples. The sandhi splitter was integrated with a Kannada spell checker and a mechanism for generating suggestions was added. A comprehensive, platform independent, standalone spell checker with sandhi splitter application software was thus developed and tested extensively for its efficiency and correctness. A comparative analysis of this spell checker with sandhi splitter was made and results concluded that the Kannada spell checker with sandhi splitter has an improved performance. It is twice as fast, 200 times more space efficient, and it is 90% accurate in case of complex nouns and 80% accurate for complex verbs. Such a spell checker with sandhi splitter will be of foremost significance in machine translation systems, voice processing, etc. This is the first sandhi splitter in Kannada and the advantage of the novel algorithm is that, it can be extended to all Indian languages.","","978-1-5090-6367-3","10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8125964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125964","Natural language processing;Morphology;Computational linguistics;Sandhi splitter;Spell checker","Dictionaries;Compounds;Morphology;Grammar;Redundancy;Mood;Software","natural language processing;speech processing;text analysis","Kannada spell checker;sandhi splitter application software;sandhi words;spelling errors","","2","","","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, one class of deep learning models, known as deep belief networks (DBNs), can discover intricate statistical structure in large datasets in a completely unsupervised fashion, by learning a generative model of the data using Hebbian-like learning mechanisms. Although these self-organizing systems can be conveniently formalized within the framework of statistical mechanics, their internal functioning remains opaque, because their emergent dynamics cannot be solved analytically.

To this end, in this work, for the first time, we propose an extremely area- and energy-efficient LSTM network implementation exploiting the passive resistive random access memory (RRAM) crossbar array. We developed a hardware-aware LSTM network simulation framework and performed an extensive analysis of the proposed LSTM implementation considering the nonideal hardware artifacts such as spatial (device-to-device) and temporal variations, nonlinearity, and noise, utilizing an experimentally calibrated comprehensive phenomenological model for passive RRAM crossbar array. Our results indicate that the proposed passive RRAM crossbar-based LSTM network implementation not only outperforms the prior digital and active 1Transistor-1RRAM (1T-1R) crossbar-based LSTM implementations by more than three orders of magnitude in terms of area and two orders of magnitude in terms of training energy for identical network accuracy but also exhibits robustness against spatial and temporal variations and noise, and a faster convergence rate.

A description of sentence syntax modeling is used to automate the process of analysis and synthesis of natural language texts. The article reveals the features of synthesizing sentences of different languages with the use of generative grammars. The article examines influence of norms and rules of a language on the process of constructing grammars. The use of generative grammars has great potential in the development and creation of automated systems for text content processing, linguistic support for linguistic computer systems etc. In natural languages there are situations where notions, which are dependent on the context, are described as independent of context, i.e. in terms of context-free grammars. This description is complicated by the formation of new categories and rules. The article features the process of introducing new restrictions on these grammar classes through the introduction of new rules. Uncut grammars were received if the number of characters in the right part of the rules were not less than the number of characters in the left one. Then by replacing the only character a context-sensitive grammar was received. A grammar with only one character in the left part of the rule is called a context-free grammar. No further natural restrictions may be applied to the left part of a rule. Based on the importance of automatic processing of text content in modern information media (e.g., information retrieval systems, machine translation, semantic, statistical, optical and acoustic analysis and speech synthesis, automated editing, extracting knowledge from text content, abstracting and annotating text content, indexing text content, teaching and didactic, management of linguistic corpora, various tools for lexicography, etc.), specialists are actively looking for new models, ways of their description and methods of automatic processing of text content. One of such methods lies in developing general principles of syntactic lexicographical systems formation and developing mentioned systems of processing text content for specific languages based in these principles. Any parsing tools consist of two parts: a knowledge base of concrete natural language and parsing algorithm, i.e. a set of standard operators of text content processing based on this knowledge. The source of grammatical knowledge is data of morphological analysis and various tables filled with concepts and linguistic units. They are the result of an empirical study of the text content in natural language by experts aiming at highlighting the basic laws for parsing.","","978-1-5386-1639-0","10.1109/STC-CSIT.2017.8098797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8098797","text;Ukrainian language;algorithm;content monitoring;keywords;linguistic analysis;parsing;generative grammar;sentence structure scheme;linguistic information system","Grammar;Pragmatics;Natural languages;Information systems;Syntactics;Semantics;Analytical models","computational linguistics;context-free grammars;context-sensitive grammars;natural language processing;text analysis","Ukrainian texts;generative grammars;linguistic modeling;sentence syntax modeling;natural language texts;automated systems;text content processing;linguistic computer systems;context-free grammar;grammar classes;uncut grammars;context-sensitive grammar;automatic processing;acoustic analysis;speech synthesis;syntactic lexicographical systems formation;concrete natural language;sentence parsing;keyword determination;modern information media;grammatical knowledge;morphological analysis;linguistic units;text content abstraction;text content annotation;text content indexing","","7","","40","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Sensory aids for the blind: A challenging problem with lessons for the future","P. W. Nye; J. C. Bliss","California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA; Stanford Research Institute, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Proceedings of the IEEE","28 Jun 2005","1970","58","12","1878","1898","The two major objectives of sensory aids for the blind are to permit access to printed matter and to permit safe travel through the environment. The difficulties of designing technological means to achieve these objectives are in many respects unrelated to the concerns of the engineering laboratory. Social, economic, political, and logistic considerations all play a role. The ""blind population"" in the United States includes both the totally blind and those with a wide range of visual impairment. This population totals about 400 000 people in which the aged, the multiply handicapped, and those with significant residual vision predominate. Singly handicapped, working-aged people are the initial targets of the current sensory aids. Expansion of their range of usefulness to larger fractions of the blind population is expected to come later. About 800 agencies serve the blind population in the United States, and in 1967 they were responsible for an annual expenditure of $500 million. In contrast the sensory-aids research and development budget was less than $1 million. Nevertheless, several potentially useful prototype devices have been developed and are about to be evaluated in this country; at least one is of foreign origin. But if these devices are ever to have the opportunity of reaching the blind public, then mechanisms for evaluation, field trials, manufacture, and deployment must be set up. The field of currently active sensory-aids research programs is reviewed. Several programs are concerned with increasing the convenience and accessibility of braille by the application of computer technology. Nevertheless, despite the unquestionable value of these developments, the usefulness of braille is limited by its bulk, its cost, and the transcription time. To provide direct access to printed documents several devices are being developed that transform optical images from a printed page into auditory or tactile displays requiring motivation and training for effective use. These machines are termed ""direct-translation"" units and are designed for simplicity and low cost. Other systems utilize print recognition techniques to create a reading machine providing braille or speech as an output. These machines offer potentially faster reading rates and their use promises to be easier to learn than direct-translation machines, but at the penalty of complexity and high cost. Several mobility aids designed to augment the cane or guide dog have recently been developed. These are also described. The prospects of achieving direct input to the visual cortex are discussed. It is apparent that the cost of this research is likely to be extremely high in relation to the size of the blind population which might ultimately benefit. Somewhat more easily realizable is a visual substitution system involving stimulation of an area of the skin. Several systems are being developed but all suffer from limitations in image resolution. Finally, an examination of the organization of research and funding reveals that the U.S. program is small, poorly coordinated, and contains some seemingly unnecessary duplication of effort. Several obvious lessons emerge which, if heeded, could greatly improve the effectiveness of sensory-aids research by providing development, manufacture, evaluation, and deployment services within an integrated program.","1558-2256","","10.1109/PROC.1970.8061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1449991","","Sensory aids;Costs;Manufacturing;Design engineering;Laboratories;Environmental economics;Logistics;Aging;Research and development;Prototypes","","","","39","2","107","IEEE","28 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the fact that the training data may contain highly sensitive information, e.g., personal medical records, directly sharing them among the users (i.e., participants) or centrally storing them in one single location may pose a considerable threat to user privacy. In this paper, we present a practical privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning system that allows users to cooperatively build a collective deep learning model with data of all participants, without direct data sharing and central data storage. In our system, each participant trains a local model with their own data and only shares model parameters with the others. To further avoid potential privacy leakage from sharing model parameters, we use functional mechanism to perturb the objective function of the neural network in the training process to achieve  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy. In particular, for the first time, we consider the existence of unreliable participants, i.e., the participants with low-quality data, and propose a solution to reduce the impact of these participants while protecting their privacy. We evaluate the performance of our system on two well-known real-world datasets for regression and classification tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is robust against unreliable participants, and achieves high accuracy close to the model trained in a traditional centralized manner while ensuring rigorous privacy protection.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2019.2939713","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822207,U1636219); Equipment Pre-Research Joint Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Youth Talent)(grant numbers:6141A02033327); Outstanding Youth Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2017CFA047); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042019kf0210); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872277,41571437); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2018CFB482); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702380); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2017CFB134); Hubei Provincial Technological Innovation Special Funding Major Projects(grant numbers:2017AAA125); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8825829","Collaborative learning;deep learning;privacy","Deep learning;Data models;Privacy;Differential privacy;Collaboration;Neural networks","data protection;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","classification tasks;regression tasks;parallel computing GPU;privacy protection;low-quality data;ε-differential privacy;training process;neural network;potential privacy leakage;collective deep learning model;privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning system;user privacy;personal medical records;neural-network-based deep learning;massive user data;unreliable participants","","91","","50","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underlying framework for all these models is usually a deep neural network comprising an encoder and a decoder. Although simple encoder-decoder models produce competitive results, many researchers have proposed additional improvements over these seq2seq models, e.g., using an attention-based model over the input, pointer-generation models, and self-attention models. However, such seq2seq models suffer from two common problems: 1) exposure bias and 2) inconsistency between train/test measurement. Recently, a completely novel point of view has emerged in addressing these two problems in seq2seq models, leveraging methods from reinforcement learning (RL). In this survey, we consider seq2seq problems from the RL point of view and provide a formulation combining the power of RL methods in decision-making with seq2seq models that enable remembering long-term memories. We present some of the most recent frameworks that combine the concepts from RL and deep neural networks. Our work aims to provide insights into some of the problems that inherently arise with current approaches and how we can address them with better RL models.

Significant accuracy improvements can be achieved using complex LSTM model with a large memory requirement and high computational complexity, which is time-consuming and energy demanding. The low-latency and energy-efficiency requirements of the real-world applications make model compression and hardware acceleration for LSTM an urgent need. In this paper, several hardware-efficient network compression schemes are introduced first, including structured top- $k$  pruning, clipped gating, and multiplication-free quantization, to reduce the model size and the number of matrix operations by 32  $\times $  and 21.6  $\times $ , respectively, with negligible accuracy loss. Furthermore, efficient hardware architectures for accelerating the compressed LSTM are proposed, which support the inference of multi-layer and multiple time steps. The computation process is judiciously reorganized and the memory access pattern is well optimized, which alleviate the limited memory bandwidth bottleneck and enable higher throughput. Moreover, the parallel processing strategy is carefully designed to make full use of the sparsity introduced by pruning and clipped gating with high hardware utilization efficiency.

Recently, stochastic computing (SC) has been considered for implementing neural networks and reducing the hardware consumption. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and noise-tolerant long short-term memory-based RNN using SC. In this SC-RNN, a hybrid structure is developed by utilizing SC designs and binary circuits to improve the hardware efficiency without significant loss of accuracy. The area and energy consumption of the proposed design are between 1.6%-2.3% and 6.5%-11.2%, respectively, of a 32-bit floating-point (FP) implementation. The SC-RNN requires significantly smaller area and lower energy consumption in most cases compared to an 8-bit fixed point implementation.

Recently, the multilayer long short-term memory (LSTM) models have been demonstrated to achieve promising performance on word-level language modeling. For each LSTM layer, larger hidden size usually means more diverse semantic features, which enables the LM to perform better. However, we have observed that when a certain LSTM layer reaches a sufficiently large scale, the promotion of overall effect will slow down, as its hidden size increases. In this article, we analyze that an important factor leading to this phenomenon is the high correlation between the newly extended hidden states and the original hidden states, which hinders diverse feature expression of the LSTM. As a result, when the scale is large enough, simply lengthening the LSTM hidden states will cost tremendous extra parameters but has little effect. We propose a simple yet effective improvement on each LSTM layer consisting of a large-scale Major LSTM and a small-scale Minor LSTM to break the high correlation between the two parts of hidden states, which we call Major–Minor LSTMs (MMLSTMs). In experiments, we demonstrate the LM with MMLSTMs surpasses the existing state-of-the-art model on Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2 (WT2) data sets and outperforms the baseline by 3.3 points in perplexity on WikiText-103 data set without increasing model parameter counts.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2947563","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1400603); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8924934","Language model (LM);long short-term memory (LSTM);natural language processing (NLP);shortcut connections","Feature extraction;Semantics;Correlation;Natural language processing;Data models;Task analysis;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;text analysis","major-minor long short-term memory;LM;multilayer long short-term memory models;LSTM hidden states;feature expression;semantic features;natural language processing systems;word-level language model","","9","","49","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have been demonstrated to be useful in broad application fields such as image recognition, speech processing, machine translation, and scientific computing. Meanwhile, innovative self-aware techniques, whereby a system can dynamically react based on continuously sensed information from the execution environment, have attracted attention from both academia and industry. Actually, various self-aware techniques have been applied to NN systems to significantly improve the computational speed and energy efficiency. This article surveys state-of-the-art self-aware NN systems (SaNNSs), which can be achieved at different layers, that is, the architectural layer, the physical layer, and the circuit layer. At the architectural layer, SaNNS can be characterized from a data-centric perspective where different data properties (i.e., data value, data precision, dataflow, and data distribution) are exploited. At the physical layer, various parameters of physical implementation are considered. At the circuit layer, different logics and devices can be used for high efficiency. In fact, the self-awareness of existing SaNNS is still in a preliminary form. We propose a comprehensive SaNNS from a new perspective, that is, the model layer, to exploit more opportunities for high efficiency. The proposed system is called as MinMaxNN, which features model switching and elastic sparsity based on monitored information from the execution environment. The model switching mechanism implies that models (i.e., min and max model) dynamically switch given different inputs for both efficiency and accuracy. The elastic sparsity mechanism indicates that the sparsity of NNs can be dynamically adjusted in each layer for efficiency. The experimental results show that compared with traditional SaNNS, MinMaxNN can achieve 5.64× and 19.66% performance improvement and energy reduction, respectively, without notable loss of accuracy and negative effects on developers' productivity.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2020.2977722","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB1003101,2018AAA0103300,2017YFA0700900,2017YFA0700902,2017YFA0700901); NSF of China(grant numbers:61732007,61432016,61532016,61672491,61602441,61602446,61732002,61702478,61732020); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:JQ18013); National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2018ZX01031102); Transformation and Transfer of Scientific and Technological Achievements of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:KFJ-HGZX-013); Key Research Projects in Frontier Science of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:QYZDB-SSW-JSC001); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Science(grant numbers:XDB32050200,XDC01020000); Standardization Research Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:BZ201800001); Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) through the Beijing Nova Program of Science and Technology(grant numbers:Z191100001119093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9045930","Self-aware neural network (NN) processors","Artificial neural networks;Neural networks;Self-aware;Monitoring;Sensors;Program processors;Logic gates","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","architectural layer;physical layer;circuit layer;data-centric perspective;comprehensive SaNNS;model layer;model switching mechanism;elastic sparsity mechanism;neural network processors;deep learning tasks;multilayer artificial NNs;self-aware NN systems;self-aware neural network systems;MinMaxNN","","6","","106","IEEE","24 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Long Term Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are widely used variants of RNN due to their effectiveness in overcoming gradient vanishing and exploding problems; however, compared to conventional RNN, their massive storage and computation requirements hinder their application. In addition, the recurrent structure of RNNs makes them prone to accumulate errors, resulting in a severe loss of accuracy. In this work, we propose a hybrid-iterative compression (HIC) algorithm for LSTM/GRU. By exploiting the error sensitivity of RNN, the gating units are divided into error-sensitive and error-insensitive groups, that are compressed using different algorithms. By using this approach, a  $37.1\times /32.3\times $  compression ratio is achieved with negligible accuracy loss for LSTM/GRU. Further, an energy efficient accelerator for bidirectional RNNs is proposed. In this accelerator, the data flow of the matrix operation unit based on the block structure matrix (MOU-S) is improved through rearranging weights; the utilization of BRAM is improved through a fine-grained parallelism configuration of matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs). Meanwhile, the timing matching strategy alleviates the load-imbalance problem between MOU-S and the matrix operation unit based on top- $k$  pruning (MOU-P). When running at 200MHz on Xilinx ADM-PCIE-7V3 FPGA, the proposed design achieves an improvement in energy efficiency in a range of 5%-237% for LSTM networks, and an improvement of 58% for GRU networks compared with state-of-the-art designs.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2021.3091318","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62022041,61871216); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:2018- XYDXX-009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9467293","Recurrent neural network (RNN);neural network compression;FPGAs","Logic gates;Sensitivity;Recurrent neural networks;Hardware;Matrix converters;Field programmable gate arrays;Compression algorithms","data compression;field programmable gate arrays;iterative methods;matrix algebra;power aware computing;recurrent neural nets","bidirectional recurrent neural networks;error sensitivity;sequential applications;long term short term memory;gated recurrent unit;gating units;energy efficient accelerator;bidirectional RNNs;matrix operation unit;block structure matrix;energy efficiency;LSTM networks;GRU networks;hybrid-iterative compression;Xilinx ADM-PCIE-7V3 FPGA;frequency 200.0 MHz","","4","","32","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing sentiment analysis methods suffer from the dominant contribution of text modality in the dataset; this is called text dominance. In this context, we emphasize that weakening the dominant role of text modality is important for MSA tasks. To solve the above two problems, from the perspective of datasets, we first propose the Chinese multimodal opinion-level sentiment intensity (CMOSI) dataset. Three different versions of the dataset were constructed: manually proofreading subtitles, generating subtitles using machine speech transcription, and generating subtitles using human cross-language translation. The latter two versions radically weaken the dominant role of the textual model. We randomly collected 144 real videos from the Bilibili video site and manually edited 2557 clips containing emotions from them. From the perspective of network modeling, we propose a multimodal semantic enhancement network (MSEN) based on a multiheaded attention mechanism by taking advantage of the multiple versions of the CMOSI dataset. Experiments with our proposed CMOSI show that the network performs best with the text-unweakened version of the dataset. The loss of performance is minimal on both versions of the text-weakened dataset, indicating that our network can fully exploit the latent semantics in nontext patterns. In addition, we conducted model generalization experiments with MSEN on MOSI, MOSEI, and CH-SIMS datasets, and the results show that our approach is also very competitive and has good cross-language robustness.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3282953","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62207029,62271454,62176018); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1403903,2021YFF0900700); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L223033); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154459","Chinese multimodal opinion-level sentiment intensity (CMOSI) dataset;multimodal multihead attention fusion;multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA);semantic enhancement","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Sentiment analysis;Semantics;Analytical models;Data models;Annotations","","","","1","","","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"39 Managing Data in Sign Language Corpora","S. G. Thomason",NA,"The Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management","","2021","","","463","470","With the arrival of video on desktop computers at the start of this century, the use of data in the study of signed languages saw substantial changes. Where before, few larger data sets were created (primarily for observational data in first-l anguage acquisition), from 2004 onward many research groups started constructing sign language corpora (Crasborn et al. 2007; Johnston 2009). These corpora were virtually all elicited, rather than harvested from external sources, as such sources simply did not exist in sufficient quantities. Even today, it is debatable whether YouTube and similar online platforms contain a large enough collection of the use of a particular sign language from which a balanced sample could be created (Crasborn & van Winsum 2014). In addition, the available metadata are often limited and legal and ethical issues also make it difficult to actually use such data for research purposes. An exception is the TV-recorded weather reports that were interpreted from spoken German to German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, or DGS), and collected in a corpus by Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen for the purpose of developing sign language technologies (Bungeroth et al. 2006). Such a limited domain of language use has its advantages for developing automatic sign recognition and machine translation of sign to speech. Because the topic of language use is constrained, the ""type-token ratio"" of signs will be better (fewer signs occurring only once, for instance).","","9780262366076","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9740289.pdf&bkn=9740254&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","23 Mar 2022","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"
"4 Indigenous Peoples, Ethics, and Linguistic Data","S. G. Thomason",NA,"The Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management","","2021","","","49","60","The world is dominated by just a few large languages that mediate mass communication, social media, education, politics, and many other domains. A study by Kornai (2013) found just sixteen of the world's nearly seven thousand languages to be ""digitally thriving,"" with a firmly established online presence and the tools necessary to live and interact in an increasingly digitally connected world. These sixteen languages are spoken natively by some 2.8 billion people, or nearly 40% of the world's population. These are the languages of Big Data, machine translation, automated speech recognition— the ones that technology companies care most about. For these languages, ethical protocols are largely driven by commercial interests and entail regional legal structures pertaining to data governance.<superscript>1</superscript> But the vast majority of the world's linguistic diversity is found elsewhere: namely, within the thousands of minority languages, many of which belong to small, often politically and economically marginalized Indigenous groups.<superscript>2</superscript> Data from these small and often critically endangered languages are key for understanding linguistic diversity—a major focus of linguistic science—but also for maintaining that diversity through language maintenance and reclamation efforts. Linguistic research on Indigenous minority languages takes place against a backdrop of increasing threats to Indigenous language vitality and pressures to shift away from Indigenous languages toward languages of wider communication—often colonial languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Mandarin). We emphasize that language endangerment, along with the response by various stakeholders such as linguists, archivists, and especially the communities these languages come from, is central to the discussion of Indigenous peoples, ethics, and linguistic data. While the causes of language endangerment are many and complex, social and cultural dislocation due to unequal power relations between minority communities and majority populations have played major roles in facilitating language shift (Grenoble 2011). Traditional models of linguistic research often mirror these unequal power relationships (Leonard 2018), with the result that linguists researching Indigenous languages may be seen as agents of social and cultural dislocation as well. Moreover, Indigenous communities may view linguistic research as out of step with the impending threat of language loss. In particular, communities experiencing rapid language shift and consequent language endangerment may take a more holistic view of language research as being embedded within a process of language reclamation (cf. Leonard 2017) and psychological healing (cf. Meek 2010; Jacob 2013) against a backdrop of numerous ethical violations that underlie language shift. Hence, any discussion of ethics in linguistic data requires a discussion of Indigenous data and must adhere to protocols for working with Indigenous data, as well as to the broader sociopolitical contexts in which language work takes place. However, where formal, legal frameworks do exist governing Indigenous and minority language data, these frameworks tend to be modeled on those developed for large languages rather than the cultural values or political concerns of Indigenous populations. We thus focus in this chapter on ethical issues in relation to Indigenous languages and the communities they come from, for it is in this context that the intersection of people, ethics, and data has been least formalized, despite its significant implications.","","9780262366076","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9740256.pdf&bkn=9740254&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","23 Mar 2022","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

In many fields—computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, game playing, and others—deep learning has brought unprecedented progress and become the method of choice. Will the same happen in robotics and automation? In a sense, it is already happening. Today, deep learning is often the most common keyword for work presented at major robotics conferences. At the same time, robots, as physical systems, pose unique challenges for deep learning in terms of sample efficiency and safety in real-world robot applications. With robots, data are abundant, but labels are sparse and expensive to acquire. Reinforcement learning in principle does not require data labeling but does require a significant number of iterations on real robots. Transferring the capabilities learned in simulation to real robots and collecting sufficient data for practical robot applications both present major challenges. Further, mistakes by robot learning systems are often much more costly than those by their counterparts in the virtual world. These mistakes may cause irreversible damage to robot hardware or, even worse, loss of human lives. Safety is thus paramount for robot learning systems.

"Keynote - AI for the Public Sector and the Case of Legal NLP","M. Stürmer","**, **, **, **","2023 Ninth International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG)","15 May 2023","2023","","","1","2","Recent innovations such as ChatGPT have increased public interest in artificial intelligence (AI). The keynote explained why AI is not just a short-term hype but has a long history of spanning several eras. A recent revolution has been in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This interdisciplinary field of research is also known as computational linguistics. It is usually implemented by specific NLP tasks, ranging from simple processing steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization to Part of Speech (PoS) tagging and topic modeling. A second, more complex set of NLP tasks includes Namend Entity Recognition (NER), information retrieval, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, text similarity, and coreference resolution. Finally, the most challenging NLP tasks are considered Question Answering (QA), text summarization, text simplification, text generation, text translation, and chatbots. NLP has especially great potential in the public sector. For example, a new multilingual legal language model for more than 20 languages, developed for the Swiss Federal Court, offers opportunities to increase accessibility of legal documents for citizens while preserving the digital sovereignty of government institutions. These technical results of the National Research Program (NRP) 77 project “Open Justice versus Privacy” are published on Hugging Face, a platform for sharing openly available machine learning models and datasets. Today, it is mostly private companies that build such Large Language Models (LLM), because it requires a large amount of computational resources and highly skilled engineers. For example, to train the new LLaMA model, Meta AI (Facebook) needed more than $30 million worth of graphical processing units (GPU). In addition, 450 MWh of electricity worth about $90,000 was needed to process the data on these GPUs. Negative for innovation and the environment, Meta AI released the LLaMA model only under a non-commercial license. This means that startups and other companies cannot use the model for their own services. This calls for a discussion about how “open” today's machine learning models should be and what “open” actually means in the age of AI. The keynote presentation therefore included a proposal of 5 elements of such machine learning models that need to be openly available and licensed under an official open license in order to speak of an Open AI Model. This term is used by the United Nations definition of Digital Public Goods. These five elements include 1) model architecture (detailed scientific publications), 2) hyperparameters (built configuration), 3) training data (labeled and unlabeled datasets), 4) model weights and intermediate checkpoints (parameters), and 5) source code to build the model (programming scripts etc.). A truly openly available AI model is BLOOM, an LLM from the BigScience initiative. It was built by more than 1000 researchers from over 70 countries, trained on an infrastructure that would have cost EUR 3 million. BLOOM was released on July 12th, 2022 on Hugging Face and is licensed under the Responsible AI License (RAIL), a new type of AI license that incorporates ethical aspects while preserving the openness of the machine learning elements described.","2573-1998","979-8-3503-2450-1","10.1109/ICEDEG58167.2023.10122084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10122084","","","chatbots;computational linguistics;graphics processing units;law;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval);sentiment analysis;social networking (online);text analysis","AI license;artificial intelligence;chatbots;ChatGPT;computational linguistics;computational resources;digital public goods;graphical processing units;Hugging Face;information retrieval;large language models;legal documents;legal NLP;LLaMA model;machine learning;Meta AI;multilingual legal language model;namend entity recognition;National Research Program 77 project;natural language processing;noncommercial license;official open license;Open AI Model;public sector;question answering;relationship extraction;scientific publications;Swiss Federal Court;text generation;text similarity;text simplification;text summarization;text translation;topic modeling;United Nations definition","","","","","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep Neural Networks, or DNNs, have led to breakthrough accuracy improvements for tasks formerly considered AI, like speech recognition, image classification, and translation. Recurrent DNNs are differentiable universal computers. DNNs are layered structures of relatively simple functions with millions to billions of learnable model parameters. The challenge is that these model parameters are obtained by machine learning of sometimes billions of data samples, which often requires harnessing a farm of powerful multi-GPU servers. Microsoft's open source Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is used to create the DNNs that power many Microsoft services and products. It enables researchers and data scientists to easily code such neural networks at the right abstraction level, and to efficiently train and test them on production-scale data. This talk will discuss the Cognitive Toolkit and how it takes a functional-style, differentiable user program, compiles it into a computation graph for GPU execution, and distributes execution of its training across a GPU-server farm. This talk will explain how the toolkit's design intersects with several topics of interest to the three co-located conferences.","","978-1-5090-4931-8","10.1109/CGO.2017.7863722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7863722","","","computer science;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);Linux;neural nets;public domain software","computer science;Microsoft cognitive toolkit;open source large-scale deep learning toolkit;windows;Linux;deep neural networks;DNN;image classification;speech recognition;universal computers;learnable model parameters;machine learning;Microsoft open source cognitive toolkit;CNTK;data scientists;production scale data;cognitive toolkit;differentiable user program;GPU-server farm","","10","","","IEEE","28 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Language modeling is used in various computing tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, optical character and handwriting recognition and information retrieval and other applications. Whereas n-gram is considered as a traditional language model, neural language model has been emerging recently as a means to approximate the probability of a sentence using neural networks and word embeddings. An advantage of a neural language model is that it can be further applied to other NLP tasks where the training datasets may be limited. In this talk, we realize this idea by introducing the usage of a Vietnamese neural model language trained from a large corpus of social media data. When further applying this neural model language with other NLP tasks including entity recognition, spam detection and topic modeling with relatively small training datasets; we witness improved performance achieved, as compared to other existing approaches using deep learning with typical word embedding techniques.","","978-1-5386-7983-8","10.1109/NICS.2018.8606865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606865","","Computational modeling;Task analysis;Urban areas;Training;Computer science;Probability distribution;Speech recognition","natural language processing;neural nets;statistical distributions","word embeddings;topic modeling;spam detection;NLP tasks;Vietnamese neural language model;entity recognition;neural networks;statistical language model","","","","0","IEEE","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples of the success of data science abound—applying new machine-learning techniques to problems such as vision and speech recognition and translation has achieved commonplace levels of performance that would have seemed impossible a few years ago. In parallel, developments in pervasive computing increasingly enable us to instrument our physical environment with complex sensors and actuators and create an interconnected world that generates huge volumes of data. The importance of these trends can be seen in the growing momentum of exemplars such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart environments, and augmented cognition. Pervasive data science is characterized by a focus on the collection, analysis (inference), and use of data (actuation) in pursuit of the vision of ubiquitous computing1 and raises multiple new challenges, demanding new approaches to how we capture, process, and use data in pervasive environments. Beyond the hype, it is clear that our world is becoming increasingly data centric, in which both physical and electronic services depend on the collection, analysis, and application of large volumes of heterogeneous data.

Many NLP applications has been built based on existing language resources. Over the past decade, major languages such as English, French, and German have experienced a significant progress and have a tremendous language resources for building application, linguistic research, and future use. Unlike these major languages, many other languages of the world are still neglected from the perspectives of language engineer. As a result, it is difficult to find any existing language resources in minor languages including languages og Indonesia. With regard to Indonesia, it has 742 languages that most of them are under-resourced languages.

In particular, deep neural networks (DNNs) and their variants have proved their efficacy in a wide range of image, video, speech, and biomedical applications. To achieve incremental accuracy improvement, state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms tend to aggressively increase the depth and size of the network, which imposes ever-increasing computational capacity and storage cost in hardware. Although graphic processing units (GPUs) are the dominant technology in the training of the DNN models at the cloud, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware accelerators are being developed to run large-scale deep learning algorithms for inference (or even training) on-chip. This provides opportunities to bring the AI closer to the edge device for applications such as autonomous driving, machine translation, and smart wearable devices, where severe constraints exist in performance, power, and area.","2329-9231","","10.1109/JXCDC.2019.2913526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732946","","Special issues and sections;Nonvolatile memory;Random access memory;Neural networks;Synapses;Neurons;Spintronics;Neuromorphic engineering","","","","","","0","OAPA","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These statistical systems use this information to translate new documents. For years, because processors were not fast enough to handle the extensive computation these systems require, many experts considered statistical systems inferior to rule-based systems. However, when the Speech Group of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology's Information Access Division tested 20 machine translation technologies, a statistical system developed by Google finished in first place. The NIST test results' significance is that Google and other organizations will invest more time, money, and talent into researching this approach. Meanwhile, faster processors and other advances are making statistical translation technology more accurate and thus more useful. However, the approach must still clear several hurdles - such as still inadequate accuracy and problems recognizing idioms - before it can be useful for mission-critical tasks.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2005.353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1516048","Machine translation technology;Linguistics;Statistical translation systems;Translation technology","Snow;Humans;Natural languages;Dictionaries;Mathematical analysis;Mathematical model;Machine intelligence;Laboratories;Speech processing;Feeds","language translation;natural languages;search engines;Internet;document handling","statistical machine translation;search engine;rule based technology;document handling;Internet","","4","","","IEEE","10 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Israeli researchers have developed a computational machine-learning model based on how bacteria communicate and act collectively. Their algorithm could enable development of robots that could form smart teams and also improve work in areas such as swarm computing. Paleontologists have turned to artificial intelligence to analyze satellite imagery and create a model of where best to find sites with fossils. The researchers trained their AI-based application to recognize the spectral signatures of different types of land cover and combined that data with elevation and slope information to identify likely fossil-bearing sites.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2012.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212520","hidden Markov models;language recognition;machine translation;Google Voice;Microsoft;AT&;T;Nuance Communications;Apple Siri;bacteria;swarm computing;collective decision making;paleontology;fossils;satellite imagery","Hidden Markov models;Google;Speech processing;Decision making;Particle swarm optimization;Machine learning;Machine intelligence","archaeology;biology computing;geology;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;mobile robots;palaeontology","language tool;artificial intelligence;bacteria;intelligent behavior;machine learning;autonomous robot;paleontologists;fossil","","2","","","IEEE","5 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
